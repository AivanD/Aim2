Actin-related proteins (ARPs) also play central roles in plant growth, including cell elongation and development. However, the relationships between ARPs and GA signaling and biosynthesis are not fully understood. Here, we isolated OsGASD, encoding an ARP subunit from rice (Oryza sativa), using the Ac/Ds knockout system. The osgasd knockout (Ko) mutation reduced GA3 content in shoots as well as plant growth and height. However, GA application restored the plant height of the osgasd Ko mutant to a height similar to that of the wild type (WT). Rice plants overexpressing OsGASD (Ox) showed increased plant height and grain yield compared to the WT. Transcriptome analysis of flag leaves of OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko plants revealed that OsGASD regulates cell development and the expression of elongation-related genes. These observations suggest that OsGASD is involved in maintaining GA homeostasis to regulate plant development, thereby affecting rice growth and productivity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1204</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>1217</offset><text>Plant architecture is important for the productivity of rice (Oryza sativa), a major crop worldwide. Rice productivity is mainly determined by a few major factors such as plant height, number of panicles, filling rate, number of spikelets per panicle, total grain weight, thousand-grain weight, and grain size. The most important of these is total grain weight, which is determined by grain size and filling rate. Grain size and filling rate in rice are controlled by several regulatory factors. The development of tissues and organs such as flowers and leaves is closely related. Flag leaves provide nutrients via photosynthesis, which are crucial to floral organ and seed development. For example, transgenic plants overexpressing SPIKELET NUMBER (SPIKE) showed increased flag leaf size and spikelet number, with a 13-36% higher yield than wild-type (WT) plants. Plant morphology is determined by cell development, which strongly affects photosynthesis and metabolic activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2198</offset><text>Actin is a conserved protein with important roles in various physiological processes. Actin-related proteins (ARPs) are chromatin-modifying complexes involved in diverse intracellular processes. The ARP2/3 complexes comprise various subunits (ARPC1 to ARPC5) that contribute to nucleation during plant cell wall synthesis. ARPC2 is an important ARP2/3 subunit that interacts with filaments and microtubules in the cytoskeleton, thereby functioning in cell division and cell elongation. The mutation of ARPC2 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) affected the shapes of a variety of cell types and reduced total shoot growth. Plants deficient in ARP expression show developmental phenotypes including defects in leaves, stems, and floral organs. Arabidopsis plants lacking ARPC2 expression show sharply reduced seed yield.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3020</offset><text>Gibberellic acids (GAs) are plant hormones with a wide range of developmental activities, including plant elongation. GA-deficient plants were significantly shorter than the WT, but their height was restored to WT levels by applying GA3. Recent progress has been made in identifying genes involved in GA metabolism and signaling pathways. GA biosynthesis involves a series of pathways in which metabolic enzymes interact. Copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), a terpene cyclase, catalyzes the first specific step of the GA biosynthesis pathway to produce ent-kaurene oxidase. Morphology of CPS overexpressing-transgenic rice show similar to the WT, despite increased expression of the ent-kaurene gene. Within the GA biosynthesis pathway, dioxygenases are important for providing GA for various developmental processes, and the total biosynthesis of bioactive GA is ultimately controlled by the dioxygenases GA3ox and GA20ox. Different expression patterns of GA20ox contribute to phenotypic variation in Arabidopsis, with GA20ox overexpression increasing the production of bioactive GAs, which influence plant growth. In rice, meanwhile, functionally deficient mutants of GA20ox show a typical dwarf phenotype.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4229</offset><text>In this current study, we used the Ac/Ds knockout system to generate new loss-of-function rice mutants with growth defects. By analyzing these mutants, we identified a novel gene encoding the ARPC2 subunit, which we named gibberellic acid sensitive dwarf (GASD). To investigate the role of OsGASD in plant development, we performed phenotypic and transcriptomic analysis of OsGASD-overexpressing (Ox) and OsGASD knockout (Ko) plants. Based on our findings, we propose that OsGASD is involved in the GA biosynthetic pathway and plays important roles in regulating plant growth and productivity. Our findings also shed light on the interactions between ARP genes and GAs.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>4899</offset><text>Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>4921</offset><text>Plant materials and growth conditions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4959</offset><text>The rice cultivar Oryza sativa L.

To further explore rice productivity, we analyzed agronomic traits including the number of panicles, filling rate, number of spikelets per panicle, total grain weight, and 1,000-grain weight ( Figures 4G-K ;  Table S1 ). The number of panicles was approximately 40% lower in the osgasd Ko mutants compared to the WT plants. However, the number of panicles was not significantly elevated in OsGASD Ox plants. Total grain weight, the number of filled grains, and 1,000-grain weight of OsGASD Ox plants increased by approximately 27%, 30% and 13%, respectively, compared to WT plants. However, the filling rate was reduced in OsGASD Ox plants compared to WT plants. By contrast, the osgasd Ko mutants showed reduced values for all parameters compared to WT plants. Consequently, the total grain weight and total number of filled grains were higher in OsGASD Ox plants, but lower in osgasd Ko plants, compared to WT plants. Furthermore, the seed size and 1,000-grain weight differed among lines ( Figures 4K, L ). These results suggest that the increased grain yield in OsGASD Ox is largely due to increases in panicle length, number of filled grains, and grain weight, supporting the notion that the expression of OsGASD affects the development of seeds that form in the panicle.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">fpls-13-1027688-g004.jpg</infon><infon key="id">f4</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>24103</offset><text>Expression of OsGASD affects agronomic traits under normal growth conditions.

If OsGASD is involved regulating rice productivity by influencing flag leaf development, we reasoned that altering OsGASD expression would affect the morphology of flag leaves. To investigate the role of OsGASD in flag leaf development, we analyzed the phenotypes of OsGASD Ox, osgasd Ko, and WT plants ( Figures 5A-D ).

An analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) indicated that 46 genes were upregulated in OsGASD Ox and downregulated in osgasd Ko compared to WT plants. Moreover, 122 genes were downregulated in OsGASD Ox and upregulated in osgasd Ko plants. To identify key genes, we examined the putative functions of the DEGs by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, finding that they included a number of genes related to plant development. We selected genes with previously reported functions in rice or homologous genes reported in Arabidopsis ( Table S2 ). A previous study had indicated that plants overexpressing OsGH3-9, OsCCR5, and OsUFGT showed enhanced shoot growth and seed formation due to increased cell development and elongation. OsKS8-, OsTEM1-, and OsGrx-C7-overexpressing plants showed phenotypes similar to those of the osgasd Ko mutants, such as a dwarf stature and poor plant growth. To validated the expression patterns of these selected genes, we analyzed their expression patterns by RT-qPCR, obtaining results similar to the RNA-seq results ( Figures 5E, F ). OsCCR5, OsNCED3 and OsUFGT were upregulated in OsGASD Ox and downregulated in osgasd Ko. However, OsGH3-9 was upregulated in OsGASD Ox but was not downregulated in osgasd Ko ( Figure 5E ). OsKS8, OsTEM1 and OsGrx-C7 were downregulated in OsGASD Ox and upregulated in osgasd Ko ( Figure 5F ). These results indicate that OsGASD regulates the expression of plant development-related genes involved in flag leaf development and plant productivity, suggesting that it is helps control overall plant growth by regulating OsGASD-mediated GA biosynthesis.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>29174</offset><text>Discussion</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>29185</offset><text>ARP2/3 complex subunits are involved in shaping walled cells and branch structure in plants. For example, a knockout mutant of DISTORTED2 (DIS2), which has ARPC2 activity, has distorted trichomes (El-Din). Here we identified the OsGASD gene, which encodes a homolog of ARPC2 in rice. In osgasd Ko lines, shoot growth was reduced, leading to a dwarf phenotype in plants during all stages of development. OsGASD was expressed at higher levels in shoots than in roots ( Figures 1D, E ,  2A ,  4A,E ). Furthermore, grain size and total grain weight were significantly higher in OsGASD Ox transgenic rice than in WT plants but lower in osgasd Ko mutants ( Figure 4 ). Finally, the length and width of flag leaves were higher in OsGASD Ox plants compared to WT plants. Together, these results indicate that OsGASD is involved in shoot and seed development.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>30038</offset><text>GAs are closely related to plant growth processes, such as seed and flower development, leaf expansion, and shoot elongation. We therefore analyzed OsGASD expression in response to GA, finding that it increased in shoots (but not roots) in response to GA treatment ( Figure 2 ,  S2 ). In addition, plant height and the lengths of panicles and internodes in the osgasd Ko mutant were restored to WT levels in response to GA treatment ( Figures 2B-F ). Furthermore, the shoots of OsGASD Ox plants had higher GA3 contents than WT shoots, whereas the shoots of the osgasd Ko mutant had lower GA3 content than WT shoots. However, GA3 contents in the roots of both OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko plants were similar to those of WT plants ( Figures 3A, B ). These results suggest that OsGASD is involved in GA biosynthesis in rice shoots. In Arabidopsis, both AtCPS- and AtCPS/AtKS-overexpressing transgenic plants showed increased accumulation of ent-kaurene and ent-kaurenoic acid, two early intermediates in the GA biosynthetic pathway, but normal levels of bioactive GA. Here, we analyzed the expression of key genes involved in GA biosynthesis, such CPS, KS, KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2. Whereas KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2 were upregulated in the shoots of young OsGASD Ox plants, the expression of CPS and KS was not significantly altered ( Figure 3C ). These results indicate that OsGASD mediates the accumulation of bioactive GA in young shoots during development.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>31492</offset><text>Moreover, we analyzed the transcriptomes of OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko flag leaves by RNA-seq to explore the relationship between OsGASD expression and yield.

Specifically, OsGH3-9, OsCCR5, and OsUFGT were upregulated in OsGASD Ox plants, whereas OsKS8, OsTEM1 and OsGrx-C7 were downregulated ( Figures 5E, F ). Together, these findings suggest that the OsGASD gene is important for GA biosynthesis and the development of rice shoots.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>32046</offset><text>Previous studies have reported that plant growth processes, including cell elongation, were affected by the overexpression of the auxin-responsive GH3 gene, and its loss of function led to increased hypocotyl elongation. The cinnamoyl CoA reductase (CCR) is important role in lignin systhesis, which is involed in cell wall development and stress defense system in plant.suppression or absence of cCCR in Arabidopsis resulted in dwarfism and decreased floral organ formation (, and). Transgenic rice overexpressing GSA1, encoding a UDP-glucosyltransferase (UFGT), showed larger grain size than WT plants. The overexpression of AtCPS and AtKS increased bioactive GA contents and limited plant growth and development. Overexpression of RAV1 negatively affected leaf structure, indicating that altering the expression of this gene changes leaf structure. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing the glutaredoxin gene GRX6 showed reduced grain yield and plant height but significantly increased grain size and weight.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>33058</offset><text>However, it is not yet understood how the ARPC2 subunit OsGASD regulates the expression GA biosynthesis genes and cell-development-related genes.
