While elevated temperature is known to directly affect herbivore growth, it remains largely unclear if it indirectly influences herbivore performance by affecting the host plant they feed on. In this study, we investigated how transient exposure to high temperature influences plant herbivory-induced defenses at the transcript and metabolic level. To this end, we studied the interaction between potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants and the larvae of the potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) under different temperature regimes. We found that P. operculella larvae grew heavier on leaves co-stressed by high temperature and insect herbivory than on leaves pre-stressed by herbivory alone. We also observed that high temperature treatments altered phylotranscriptomic patterns upon herbivory, which changed from an evolutionary hourglass pattern, in which transcriptomic responses at early and late time points after elicitation are more variable than the ones in the middle, to a vase pattern. Specifically, transcripts of many herbivory-induced genes in the early and late defense stage were suppressed by HT treatment, whereas those in the intermediate stage peaked earlier. Additionally, we observed that high temperature impaired the induction of jasmonates and defense compounds upon herbivory. Moreover, using jasmonate-reduced (JA-reduced, irAOC) and -elevated (JA-Ile-elevated, irCYP94B3s) potato plants, we showed that high temperature suppresses JA signaling mediated plant-induced defense to herbivore attack. Thus, our study provides evidences on how temperature reprograms plant-induced defense to herbivores.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1874</offset><text>Supplementary Information</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1900</offset><text>The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12870-024-05404-x.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>1992</offset><text>Introduction</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2005</offset><text>Plants have evolved sophisticated mechanisms to counteract insect herbivore attacks and decrease the fitness penalties imposed by the damage they cause. How abiotic stress modulates plant herbivory-induced defensive responses has been subject of intense research over the last years. How carbon dioxide, drought, temperature, and radiation, for instance, influence plant herbivory-induced defenses has emerged as an interesting research topic and has been investigated in several different plant systems. More recently, the impact of climate change on different aspects of plants, including the interaction with herbivores has attracted considerable attention. Under a climate change scenario, the occurrence of heat waves is predicted to increase. How heat waves influence plant herbivory-induced defensive responses to insect attack in potato remains poorly investigated.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>2879</offset><text>Heat waves and high temperatures may directly influence arthropod herbivores by impacting their development, survival, and fecundity, but also indirectly by affecting their performance via plant-mediated effects. For instance, heat waves can influence plant-induced defensive responses to herbivore attack. Temperature-sensitive plants experience greater herbivory damage in warmer years. Understanding the direct and indirect effects of heat waves on herbivore performance is therefore of crucial relevance if we are to develop strategies to mitigate the potential negative consequences of climate change in agriculture.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>3501</offset><text>Plant herbivory-induced defense responses are a dynamic process divided into three distinct stages: early, intermediate, and late. In the early stage, plants perceive herbivores by detecting herbivore-specific patterns, such as wounding damages, elicitors, and activate early defense signals such as electrical signals, hydraulic waves, calcium (Ca2+), and reactive oxygen species (ROS). These early signaling events trigger downstream signaling events including the induction of phytohormonal pathways. Jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) are the main hormones in the defense against herbivores, but other hormones such as abscisic acid (ABA) and auxins (IAA) are also involved. In the intermediate stage, the modulation of plant primary metabolism occurs, including altered photosynthesis and sink/source relations. In most cases, this modulation is accompanied by the subsequent synthesis of specialized metabolites. In the later stage, the production of defensive compounds occurs, which triggers plant defensive status and resistances against herbivore attack. Remarkably, these three stages can also be captured at the transcriptomic level. Transcript levels of defense-signaling genes are altered first, then the transcript levels of primary metabolism-related genes, and lastly the transcript levels of specialized metabolism-related genes.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4857</offset><text>Transcriptomic studies on plant's response to herbivores show that the time-dependent activation for the three functional gene groups (defense-signaling, primary metabolism, and specialized metabolism) is common in many plants. This provides evidence on how plants optimize the allocation of photosynthetic resources in a sequential manner. Meanwhile, due to the selective pressure that herbivores inflict on plants in nature, these three gene groups also show unique evolutionary characteristics. Using phylotranscriptomic methods, the induced transcriptome age index (iTAI) and induced transcriptome divergence index (iTDI) of these three gene groups have been analyzed, and their evolutionary properties showed an 'hourglass (high-low-high) pattern' trend in Nicotiana attenuata: the primary metabolism gene group at middle time points has strong evolutionary constraints, whereas the defense-signaling and specialized metabolism at early and late time points have high divergent selection or relaxed purifying selection. Meanwhile, numerous studies have also found that plants have evolved distinct functional gene groups and transcriptomic responses to cope with abiotic stresses. It remains largely unclear how the activation of herbivore defense response related functional gene groups is affected by high temperatures and heat waves in plants.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6215</offset><text>Extreme temperature also significantly impacts plant metabolism, and in turn, modulates plant-herbivore interactions. For instance, the concentration of many specialized metabolites, including flavonoids, phenolics, and terpenoids, are altered in plants grown under high temperatures, which subsequently affects the performance of herbivores on plants. This is partially attributed to high temperature-driven modification of the activity of plant enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of these metabolites. Apart from endogenous metabolites, the emission of volatile organic compounds is also modulated by temperature. In potato, a cool-weather crop, for instance, high temperature enhances the emission of one key volatile organic compound (ss-caryophyllene) from herbivory-induced leaves, which reduces the attractiveness of this plant to P. operculella adult moths but enhances its recruitment to the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma chilonis of this pest, indicating that temperature can affect potato's induced defenses against these insects.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7264</offset><text>In this study, we investigated if heat waves (transient increase in temperature) modulate the herbivory-induced defensive responses of potato plants to the attack of P. operculella. We tested the hypothesis that high temperature constrains potato plant-induced defenses against the attack of P. operculella by reshaping phylotranscriptomic patterns of herbivory-responsive genes, influencing the accumulation patterns of jasmonate-associated, primary metabolism- and specialized metabolism-related genes, and by modulating the production of primary and specialized metabolites. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments including transcript, phytohormone, and metabolite measurements, and insect performance analysis. Moreover, we conducted phylotranscriptomic, transcript functional annotation followed by targeted gene expression profiling, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to investigate how temperature modulates herbivory-induced responses in potato, thereby providing important insights into the potential consequences of climate change in plant-herbivore interactions.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>8372</offset><text>Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>8394</offset><text>Plants and planting conditions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8425</offset><text>Two Solanum tuberosum varieties were used in this study: Solanum group Tuberosum RH89-039-16 (RH) and Solanum tuberosum cultivar E-Potato 3 (E3).

OSPTM was collected using a fine capillary pipette (internal diameter: 0.5 mm) while being maintained on ice. Prior to simulated herbivory treatments, twenty-day-old potato plants were transferred into two growth chambers at either high temperature (HT; 16/8 h light/dark; 35 +- 1  C/28 +- 1  C; 65% relative humidity) or control temperature (CT; 16/8 h light/dark; 22 +- 1  C/16 +- 1  C; 65% relative humidity). Plants were kept under the different temperature regimes for 3 h (between 6am and 9am) before starting the simulated herbivory treatments. For the simulated herbivory treatments, the second fully-expanded young leaves of the plants were subjected to P. operculella simulated herbivory. Actual herbivory caused by P. operculella includes both mechanical wounding and the introduction of chemical molecules present in the insect oral secretions (OSPTM) to the wounds. To simulate P. operculella herbivory, mechanically wounded plants were treated with 20 microL 1:5 diluted OSPTM. Untreated plants were used as the controls. Mechanical wounding treatments were made by rolling a pattern-tracing wheel on the leaves. Each leaf received six rows of evenly distributed tracing wheel damage on each side of the mid-vein. Leaf samples were harvested at 0, 0.5, 1, 5 and 11 h post herbivory treatment, frozen, subsequently macerated in liquid nitrogen at - 80  C till use for transcript and metabolite quantifications (Fig. 2A).

The direct effect of high temperatures on herbivores has been extensively studied. In our study, exposure to higher temperatures promoted the growth of P. operculella larvae but also increased their mortality on artificial diets (Fig. S9). However, how high temperatures in general and heatwaves, in particular, affect herbivore's performance through plant-mediated effects remains unclear. We observed that transiently exposing potato plants to extreme temperatures significantly promoted the growth of P. operculella larvae on herbivory-induced leaves, which are cool-weather crops. This insect growth promotion observed was partially modulated by the impact of temperature on plant-induced defense induction. Moreover, considering that the temperature in real field conditions is more variable than the stable conditions we used in the lab, it would be interesting to investigate how elevated ambient temperatures in natural environments affect plants' induced defenses against herbivores.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>43005</offset><text>We observed that the induction of plant defenses in potato plants in response to P. operculella herbivory follows a phylotranscriptomic hourglass pattern consistent with iTAI and iTDI patterns from herbivory-induced transcriptome responses, similar to those observed in other plant systems such as Nicotiana attenuata. Moreover, the hourglass pattern was observed in bacterial-associated elicitor-induced defense signaling. The analogous evolutionary hourglass might represent a general model for describing signaling cascades that are induced by different stresses. Clearly, more defense responses stimulated by different stresses need to be clarified with similar phylotranscriptomic approaches in other plant species to test the robustness of the hourglass phenomena.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>43776</offset><text>The iTAI and iTDI presented different patterns when plants were exposed to high temperatures, which altered this phylotranscriptomic pattern from an hourglass- to a vase-shape pattern, suggesting high temperatures recruit different gene sets during the process of activation of herbivory-induced defenses. This change in phylotranscriptomic pattern was partially due to the suppression of several JA-associated, herbivory-induced genes when potato plants were exposed to high temperatures (Fig. 3E). We further performed GO enrichment analysis on herbivory-induced genes under control and high temperatures (Fig. S10). At the early stage (0.5 h and 1 h) of herbivory-induced defense process, while CT genes (early defense signaling gene group) were enriched in 'response to endogenous stimulus', 'response to hormone', and 'kinase activity'. HT genes were enriched in 'metabolic process' and 'photosynthesis'. Since the HT genes were more involved in metabolism than signaling, the phylotranscriptomic pattern under HT was predominantly ancient (lower iTAI) and more conserved (lower iTDI) at 0.5 h and 1 h. Similarly, CT genes (primary and specialized metabolism gene groups) at the intermediate (5 h) and late (11 h) stages of herbivory-induced defense process had different GO terms compared with HT genes. Since the HT genes were less enriched in metabolic process than CT genes, the phylotranscriptomic pattern under HT was predominantly younger (high iTAI) and more divergent (high iTDI) at 5 h and 11 h. These results suggested that HT's differential selection of the three plant's defense gene groups at each stage of herbivory-induced defense process led to different gene group functions form CT's, resulting in a different phylotranscriptomic pattern (Fig. 8). An alternative hypothesis is several plant genes associated with heat stress response, which contain large numbers of ancient and conserved genes, were activated by high temperature exposure, especially in the early stage (0.5 h and 1 h) post the herbivory, and revealing how high temperature influence all stages of herbivory-induced gene activation in future will promote the identification of key regulators in this complex signaling cascade.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">12870_2024_5404_Fig8_HTML.jpg</infon><infon key="id">Fig8</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>46032</offset><text>A module for the reprogramming of herbivory-induced defense responses by high temperature in potato plants.

Among them, jasmonates are master regulators of several herbivory-induced defense responses. We observed that JA, JA-biosynthesis and JA-signaling genes, are strongly induced upon herbivory in potato plants. Alterations in herbivory-induced JA were usually accompanied by changed accumulation of primary and specialized metabolites in many plants. In our study, the primary (soluble sugars) and secondary (SGAs, TPI) metabolites, together with their biosynthetic genes, are strongly induced upon herbivory. Meanwhile, levels of these metabolites and their related biosynthetic genes were strongly activated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment (Fig. S5 and S6), indicating that JA-signaling also plays an important role in potato's induced defense against the P. operculella (Fig. 8). Indeed, suppressing herbivory-induced JA accumulation in JA-reduced plants significantly weakened their defense against P. operculella, whereas enhancing herbivory-induced JA-Ile accumulation in JA-Ile-elevated plants and applying MeJA both strengthened their defense against P. operculella. We demonstrated that JA signaling plays an important role in plants' defense against P. operculella. Previous studies indicated that JA signaling is also related with HT.

The decrease in soluble sugar level and transcript accumulation is possibly attributed to a reduction in photosynthesis parameters due to stomata closure under elevated temperature. Also, our previous research show that the emission of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in potato (cv. Lishu 6) leaves were enhanced by high temperature treatment, which subsequently affected the plants' attractiveness to the P. operculella and its egg parasitoid wasp. This distinction might be due to the use of different cultivars, whilst it is also possible that plants may differentially regulate the production of volatile and nonvolatile secondary compounds under elevated temperature. While the alteration of levels of herbivory-induced secondary metabolites (i.e.: polyphenol oxidase and glucosinolates) by high temperature have been found in many plants including tomato and watermelon, evidence for the suppression of herbivory-induced primary metabolism by high temperature remains scarce. We propose that this suppression is related to the JA-signaling in potato plants, since the herbivory-induced JA biosynthetic genes and JA accumulations were suppressed by high temperature. However, whether suppressing JA-signaling could benefit the plant response to high temperature remains to be clarified in future.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>50903</offset><text>To gain insight into the suppression of JA-regulated defense responses associated with increased P. operculella larval weight gain under high temperature, we used JA-reduced irAOC and JA-Ile-elevated irCYP94B3s mutants in insect detached leaf bioassays to investigate the contribution of JA signaling in this context. Firstly, we observed that P. operculella larvae reared on WT leaves previously subjected to insect herbivory accumulated more biomass under high temperature than control temperature. However, this difference between the two temperature regimes was eliminated when the larvae were grown on herbivory-induced detached JA-reduced leaves. Secondly, unlike the reduced biomass on JA-Ile-elevated plants under control temperature, P. operculella larvae accumulated similar biomass on JA-Ile-elevated plants with WT plants under high temperature. We concluded that high temperature diminished plants' herbivory-induced defense and JA signaling participated in this regulation; thus leading to higher biomass of P. operculella under high temperature. Similar results were reported in recent studies that the defense mechanism of plants against insect pests is diminished by climate change in aspects of warming-mediated host-plant quality such as poor-nutrient foliage, decreased defensive compounds, and increased sensitivity to attacks. Future research efforts should focus on strategies to enhance crop defenses against herbivores in warming ecosystems.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>52372</offset><text>In summary, our study shows that transient exposure to high temperature decreases JA signaling mediated plant-induced resistance to herbivore attack by reprogramming plant transcripts and metabolome (Fig. 8). According to previous studies in other plant-insect interacting systems, positive effects of elevated ambient temperature on plants' herbivore defense were also observed. Potato is a cool-weather crop whose physiology is strongly affected by high temperature. It is likely that a 'resource reallocation' happened in potato plants when high temperature and herbivory stresses coexisted. In plants that are more adapted to eco-niche with warmer temperature, a different pattern may occur for their defense signaling activation, resource allocation and defensive secondary compounds production up on herbivory.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>53196</offset><text>Conclusions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>53208</offset><text>In this study, we found that transient exposure to high temperature constrains JA signaling-induced defenses in potato plants against the attacks of P. operculella using two potato varieties. These effects are accompanied by changes in phylotranscriptomic patterns of herbivory-responsive genes, accumulation patterns of the early defense signaling molecule jasmonate-associated, primary metabolism- and specialized metabolism-related genes, and by changes in the production of primary and specialized metabolites. The two varieties showed similar patterns in detached leaf bioassay, transcript and phytohormone accumulation upon 1 h herbivory.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>53854</offset><text>Thus, our study provides mechanistic explanations of how temperature reprogram plant defense against herbivores and insight into how the outcome of crop-herbivore interactions can be affected by global climate change.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>54072</offset><text>Electronic supplementary material</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>54106</offset><text>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>54166</offset><text>Publisher's Note</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">CONCL</infon><infon key="type">footnote</infon><offset>54185</offset><text>Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>54304</offset><text>Author contributions</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">AUTH_CONT</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>54325</offset><text>J.Z., and W.Z. conceived the project and designed the experiments; J.Z., W.H., Y.Z., Y.G., and C.L. performed the experiments and analyzed the data; Y.G., and Z.Z provided the material and detailed suggestions; J.Z., R.A.R.M and W.Z. wrote the manuscript.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>54581</offset><text>Funding</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ACK_FUND</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>54589</offset><text>This work was funded by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 32072432, and No. 32272636), the Key Research and Development Program of Zhejiang Province (Grant No. 2019C04007), the Yunnan FVF-IPM Joint Lab (No. 202303AP140018).
