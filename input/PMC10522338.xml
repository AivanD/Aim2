Natural defence compounds produced by plants have the potential to provide a general protective effect against pathogens and pests, but they are not a primary target in resistance breeding. Here, we identified a wild relative of potato, Solanum commersonii, that provides us with unique insight in the role of glycoalkaloids in plant immunity. We cloned two atypical resistance genes that provide resistance to Alternaria solani and Colorado potato beetle through the production of tetraose steroidal glycoalkaloids (SGA). Moreover, we provide in vitro evidence to show that these compounds have potential against a range of different (potato pathogenic) fungi. This research links structural variation in SGAs to resistance against potato diseases and pests. Further research on the biosynthesis of plant defence compounds in different tissues, their toxicity, and the mechanisms for detoxification, can aid the effective use of such compounds to improve sustainability of our food production.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract_title_1</infon><offset>1208</offset><text>eLife digest</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">ABSTRACT</infon><infon key="type">abstract</infon><offset>1221</offset><text>Farmers often rely on pesticides to protect their crops from disease and pests.

Many crops have become heavily dependent on the use of pesticides, but this is unsustainable as these can negatively affect the environment and their use can lead to development of pesticide resistance. The European Union's 'Farm to Fork Strategy' aims to half pesticide use and risk by 2030, a massive challenge that illustrates the urgent need for alternative disease control methods.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4085</offset><text>Wild relatives of crop species are promising sources of natural disease resistance. Monogenic resistance caused by dominant resistance (R) genes, typically caused by immune receptors that belong to the nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) class, is successfully employed by plant breeders to develop varieties with strong qualitative disease resistance. However, this type of resistance is usually restricted to a limited range of pathogens and it is often not very durable.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>4568</offset><text>More robust resistance can be obtained by combining NLRs with different recognition specificities, or by including pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognise conserved (microbe- or pathogen-derived) molecular patterns. Recent reports show that PRRs and NLRs cooperate to provide disease resistance. Alternatively, susceptibility (S) genes provide recessive resistance that can be both broad-spectrum and durable. Unfortunately, their recessive nature complicates the use of S genes in conventional breeding of autopolyploids and many mutated S genes come with pleiotropic effects.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>5160</offset><text>Besides the defences mentioned above, most plants produce specialised metabolites with antimicrobial or anti-insect activity, either constitutively (phytoanticipins) or in response to pathogen attack or herbivory (phytoalexins). These natural defence compounds are derived from a wide range of building blocks, leading to a large structural diversity throughout the plant kingdom. Specific classes of compounds can be found in different plant families, for example glucosinolates are typically found in Brassicaceae and benzoxazinoids are widely distributed among Poaceae, with further chemical diversification within plant families. Examples in various pathosystems show that the capacity for detoxification of plant defence compounds is important for pathogenicity, especially for necrotrophic pathogens which encounter toxic plant metabolites as a consequence of their lifestyle. Similarly, plant defence compounds play an important role against herbivorous insects, which have evolved various mechanisms to deal with toxic plant compounds.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6204</offset><text>While plant immune receptors can offer resistance against a restricted range of pathogens, plant defence compounds have the potential to provide a more general protection, depending on their mode of action. Plants from the nightshade family (Solanaceae) produce saponins that are characterised by a steroidal alkaloid aglycone, linked to a variable oligosaccharide chain (steroidal glycoalkaloids - SGAs). The protective effect of SGAs stems from their ability to interact with membrane sterols, disrupting the cell integrity from target organisms. In addition, they can act on the nervous system of pests and herbivores through their inhibitory effect on cholinesterase enzymes. As a consequence, SGAs can have both antimicrobial and anti-insect activity.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>6963</offset><text>Early blight is an important disease of tomato and potato that is caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Alternaria solani. In a previous study, we found a wild potato species, Solanum malmeanum (also referred to as S. commersonii subsp. malmeanum), with strong resistance against potato pathogenic Alternaria isolates and species from a number of different locations. We showed that resistance is likely caused by a single dominant locus and that it can be introgressed in cultivated potato. Resistance to necrotrophs is usually considered to be a complex, polygenic trait, or recessively inherited according to the inverse gene-for-gene model. It therefore surprised us to find a qualitative dominant resistance against early blight in S. commersonii.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">INTRO</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>7721</offset><text>In this study, we explored different accessions of S. commersonii and S. malmeanum and developed a population that segregates for resistance to early blight. Using a bulked segregant RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq) approach, we mapped the resistance locus to the top of chromosome 12 of potato. We sequenced the genome of the resistant parent of the population and identified two glycosyltransferases (GTs) that can provide resistance to susceptible S. commersonii. We show that the resistance is based on the production of tetraose SGAs and provide in vitro evidence to show that they can be effective against other fungi besides A. solani. As SGAs can be involved in resistance against insects, we also tested if they can protect against Colorado potato beetle (CPB). Combined, our results show that the tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii have potential to provide resistance against a range of potato pathogens and pests.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>8631</offset><text>Results</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>8639</offset><text>Early blight resistance maps to chromosome 12 of potato</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>8695</offset><text>To find suitable parents for a mapping study targeting early blight resistance, we performed a disease screen with A. solani isolate altNL03003 on 13 different accessions encompassing 37 genotypes of S. commersonii and S. malmeanum (Supplementary file 1). The screen showed clear differences in resistance phenotypes between and within accessions (Figure 1a). Roughly half of the genotypes were highly resistant (lesion diameters &lt;3 mm indicate that the lesions are not expanding beyond the size of the inoculation droplet) and the other half was susceptible (displaying expanding lesions), with only a few intermediate genotypes. CGN18024 is an example of an accession that segregates for resistance, with CGN18024_1 showing strong resistance and CGN18024_3 showing clear susceptibility (Figure 1b). The fact that individual accessions can display such clear segregation for resistance suggests that resistance is caused by a single gene or locus. Because of its clear segregation, S. commersonii accession CGN18024 was selected for further studies.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">elife-87135-fig1-figsupp1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig1s1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_title_caption</infon><offset>9746</offset><text>Resistance of S commersonii genotypes CGN18024_1 and CGN18024_3 against different isolates of A.solani.</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">elife-87135-fig1-figsupp1.jpg</infon><infon key="id">fig1s1</infon><infon key="section_type">FIG</infon><infon key="type">fig_caption</infon><offset>9850</offset><text>CGN18024_1 and CGN18024_3 (3 replicates per genotypes, three leaves per plant and six inoculations per leaf) were inoculated with A. solani altNL03003 (the reference isolate used throughout the manuscript), altNL21001 (isolated from a potato field in the Netherlands in 2021), and ConR1H (harvested from a potato field in Idaho, USA in 2015).

Reads were mapped to the DMv4.03 and Solyntus potato genomes. To find putative SNPs linked to resistance, we filtered for SNPs that follow the same segregation as resistance (heterozygous in resistant parent CGN18024_1 and the resistant bulk, but absent or homozygous in susceptible parent and susceptible bulk). The resulting SNPs localise almost exclusively on chromosome 12 of the DM and Solyntus genomes, with most of them located at the top of the chromosome (Figure 1d). We used a selection of SNPs distributed over chromosome 12 as high-resolution melt (HRM) markers to genotype the BSR-Seq population. This rough mapping proves that the locus for early blight resistance resides in a region of 3 Mb at the top of chromosome 12 (Figure 1:figure supplement 2).</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">title_2</infon><offset>14721</offset><text>Improved genome assembly of S. commersonii</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">RESULTS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>14764</offset><text>A genome sequence of S. commersonii is already available, but we do not know if the sequenced genotype is resistant to A. solani.

S. tuberosum typically produces the triose SGAs alpha-solanine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Rha) and alpha-chaconine (solanidine-Glu-Rha-Rha), while five major tetraose SGAs were previously identified in S. commersonii: commersonine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), dehydrocommersonine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), demissine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), dehydrodemissine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), and alpha-tomatine (tomatidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). To test if SGAs can explain resistance of S. commersonii, we measured SGA content in leaves from Atlantic and susceptible/resistant S. commersonii by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). As expected, we could detect the triose SGAs alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in susceptible S. tuberosum cv. Atlantic, but we found a remarkable difference in the SGA profile of resistant and susceptible S. commersonii. We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4).

UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b).

Potato breeders generally try to reduce SGA content in tubers, to prevent problems with toxicity and to meet safety regulations, but they do not usually consider the effect on disease resistance.

The discovery of S. commersonii genotypes with and without tetraose SGAs provides us with unique insight in the role of these compounds in plant immunity. Similar compounds are produced in Solanum species such as S. chacoense, S. chomatophilum, S. oplocense, S. paucisectum, and S. piurae, which may explain why these (or their descendants) display resistance to A. solani or CPB. The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato. The biosynthesis pathways leading to the production of these major SGAs from cultivated potato and tomato have largely been elucidated in recent years and it was found that the underlying genes occur in conserved clusters. This knowledge and the similarities between SGAs from S. commersonii and cultivated potato/tomato will help to identify the missing genes from the pathway through comparative genomics.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38316</offset><text>The broad-spectrum activity of tetraose SGAs is attractive, but this non-specificity also presents a risk. The antifungal and anti-insect activity of SGAs from S. commersonii is not restricted to potato pathogens and pests, but could also affect beneficial or commensal micro-organisms or other animals that feed on plants. In tomato fruit, alpha-tomatine is converted to esculeoside A during fruit ripening in a natural detoxification process from the plant to facilitate dispersal of the seeds by foraging animals. Unintended toxic effects of SGAs should also be taken into account when used in resistance breeding.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>38934</offset><text>Studies on alpha-tomatine and avenacin A-1 show that changes to the sugar moiety of these saponins from tomato and oat, respectively, can affect their toxicity. Tomato and oat pathogens produce enzymes that can detoxify these compounds through removal of one or more glycosyl groups. The degradation products of saponins can also suppress plant defence responses. Conversely, here we show that the resistance of S. commersonii is based on the addition of a glycosyl group to a triose saponin from S. commersonii. There is large variation in both the aglycone and the sugar moiety of SGAs from wild Solanum, with likely over 100 distinct SGAs produced in tubers. This diversity suggests a pressure to evolve novel molecules, possibly to resist detoxification or other tolerance mechanisms, reminiscent of the molecular arms race that drives the evolution of plant immune receptors. Thus, wild Solanum germplasm is not only a rich source of immune receptors, it also provides a promising source of natural defence molecules. Studies of how pathogens that naturally occur on S. commersonii, or other Solanum species producing tetraose SGAs, can tolerate SGAs produced by their hosts could help judge the durability of this type of resistance.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>40174</offset><text>As crops are usually affected by multiple diseases and pests, significant reduction of pesticide use can only be achieved if plants are naturally protected against a range of pathogen species and pests. Different strategies towards this goal have been proposed and our study underlines the potential of defence compounds that are naturally produced by plants. The fact that genes for specialised plant metabolites can occur in biosynthetic gene clusters, means that introgression breeding could help to move these compounds from wild relatives to crop species. We had already created S. commersonii x S. tuberosum hybrids with resistance to early blight in a previous study, but it is clear that potential negative effects of SGA variants on human health and the environment should be considered before these can be developed into a cultivar.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">DISCUSS</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>41018</offset><text>Additional insight in the biosynthesis pathway of the tetraose SGAs produced by S. commersonii would make it possible to employ them through metabolic engineering and allow for a more precise control of the amounts that are produced and in which tissues. Alternatively, the defence compounds could be produced in non-crop plants or other organisms and applied on crops as biological protectants. Studies on how natural defence compounds are produced in different plant tissues, their toxicity and how they are detoxified, combined with studies on how different modifications ultimately affect plant immunity and toxicity, are essential to employ them in a safe and effective manner. Such studies at the interface of plant immunity and metabolism can help to design innovative solutions to complement existing resistance breeding strategies and improve sustainability of our food production.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">METHODS</infon><infon key="type">title_1</infon><offset>41909</offset><text>Materials and methods</text></passage><passage><infon key="file">keyresource.xml</infon><infon key="id">keyresource</infon><infon key="section_type">TABLE</infon><infon key="type">table</infon><infon key="xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;

The authors demonstrated that these glycoalkaloids are suppressive to the growth of multiple pathogenic ascomycetes and furthermore, that transgenic plants expressing these glycosyltransferases in susceptible S. commersonii clones demonstrate improved resistance to specific strains of A. solani and a genotype of Colorado Potato Beetle. The study design is straightforward, yet thorough, and does a good job demonstrating the importance of these genes in resistance. This work is significant because it demonstrates the mechanism behind resistance to a necrotrophic pathogen. Resistance to this group of pathogens has historically relied on mechanisms that do not include the use of typical dominant resistance gene products (nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat proteins). The identification of these glycosyltransferases and their role in resistance will give potato breeders options for the development of markers associated with resistance to this group of pathogens. However, this may demonstrate an important battle to balance between production traits (like disease resistance) and quality traits (like glycoalkaloid content), as the two may be mutually exclusive in the development of new varieties.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70676</offset><text>10.7554/eLife.87135.3.sa3</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">title</infon><offset>70702</offset><text>Author Response</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70718</offset><text>Wolters</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70726</offset><text>Pieter J</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70735</offset><text>Wouters</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70743</offset><text>Doret</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70749</offset><text>Tikunov</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70757</offset><text>Yury M</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70764</offset><text>Ayilalath</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70774</offset><text>Shimlal</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70782</offset><text>Kodde</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70788</offset><text>Linda P</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70796</offset><text>Strijker</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70805</offset><text>Miriam F</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70814</offset><text>Caarls</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70821</offset><text>Lotte</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70827</offset><text>Visser</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70834</offset><text>Richard GF</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70845</offset><text>Vleeshouwers</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70858</offset><text>Vivianne GAA</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70871</offset><text>The following is the authors' response to the original reviews.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>70937</offset><text>Both reviewers strongly suggest that you modify the title of your paper to something that better reflects the data presented.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>71063</offset><text>We have made the title more specific to the findings described in the manuscript and revised the rest of the manuscript in response to the additional reviewer's comments.

This is somewhat similar to the work in tomatine showing that the specific hexose structure mediates the final potential bioactivity. Using the resulting transgenic complementation lines that show that the gene leads to a strong resistance phenotype to one isolate of Alternaria solani and the Colorado potato beetle.

It provides only three citations on specific links between specialized metabolism and disease resistance. However, there are actually at least 40 on specific links of camalexin and indolic phytoalexins to disease resistance. Similarly there are dozens of uncited papers on benzoxazinoids, indolic glucosinolates, aliphatic glucosinolates and tomatine to both non-host and host based resistance mechanisms. This even goes as far as showing how the pathogens resist an array of these compounds. The choices in the introduction make it appear that little is known about specialized metabolism to disease resistance but I would suggest that this is not an allusion supported by the literature. I would agree that given the breadth of specialized metabolism we have a lot of knowledge about a set of them but that there are hundreds to thousands of untested compounds but to indicate that little is known is unfair to the specialized metabolism community. This is especially true as the introduction and discussion give no image of the large body of literature on specialized metabolism to insect interactions even though this is a major component of this manuscript.</text></passage><passage><infon key="section_type">REF</infon><infon key="type">paragraph</infon><offset>73423</offset><text>We have rewritten this part of the introduction (lines 50-69).

We agree that our comments might give the (false) impression that there is not much known. There is indeed a lot of data to support the importance of specialised metabolites in resistance, especially against necrotrophic pathogens and insects.

For example, it should be noted that Botrytis BO5.10 is a tomatine sensitive isolate and the van Kan and Hahn groups have published on isolates that are resistant to saponins.

Of course, this still does not prove that the SGAs protect against all A. solani isolates and we have been more specific in referring to the Alternaria isolate that was tested.Similarly, it is impossible to make a general statement on the lack of detoxification capacity of all isolates of A. solani. It may indeed be possible that there are Alternaria isolates that are tolerant to the tetraose SGAs produced by S. commersonii, especially in natural habitats where Solanum species that produce tetraose SGAs and Alternaria co-occur.
