ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 from CGN18024_1 convert these triose SGAs from susceptible S. commersonii to tetraose SGAs, through the addition of a glucose or xylose moiety, respectively.

			"context": "Studies on alpha-tomatine and avenacin A-1 show that changes to the sugar moiety of these saponins from tomato and oat, respectively, can affect their toxicity. Tomato and oat pathogens produce enzymes that can detoxify these compounds through removal of one or more glycosyl groups. The degradation products of saponins can also suppress plant defence responses. Conversely, here we show that the resistance of S. commersonii is based on the addition of a glycosyl group to a triose saponin from S. commersonii. There is large variation in both the aglycone and the sugar moiety of SGAs from wild Solanum, with likely over 100 distinct SGAs produced in tubers. This diversity suggests a pressure to evolve novel molecules, possibly to resist detoxification or other tolerance mechanisms, reminiscent of the molecular arms race that drives the evolution of plant immune receptors. Thus, wild Solanum germplasm is not only a rich source of immune receptors, it also provides a promising source of natural defence molecules. Studies of how pathogens that naturally occur on S. commersonii, or other Solanum species producing tetraose SGAs, can tolerate SGAs produced by their hosts could help judge the durability of this type of resistance."

The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato. The biosynthesis pathways leading to the production of these major SGAs from cultivated potato and tomato have largely been elucidated in recent years and it was found that the underlying genes occur in conserved clusters. This knowledge and the similarities between SGAs from S. commersonii and cultivated potato/tomato will help to identify the missing genes from the pathway through comparative genomics."

S. tuberosum typically produces the triose SGAs alpha-solanine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Rha) and alpha-chaconine (solanidine-Glu-Rha-Rha), while five major tetraose SGAs were previously identified in S. commersonii: commersonine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), dehydrocommersonine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), demissine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), dehydrodemissine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), and alpha-tomatine (tomatidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). To test if SGAs can explain resistance of S. commersonii, we measured SGA content in leaves from Atlantic and susceptible/resistant S. commersonii by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). As expected, we could detect the triose SGAs alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in susceptible S. tuberosum cv. Atlantic, but we found a remarkable difference in the SGA profile of resistant and susceptible S. commersonii. We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4). These results suggest that the triose SGAs present in susceptible CGN18024_3 are modified to produce the tetraose SGAs in resistant CGN18024_1, by addition of an extra glucose or xylose moiety."

Several other short ORFs with homology to GTs were predicted in the resistant haplotype, but ScGTR1 (S. commersonii GT linked to resistance 1) and ScGTR2 are the only full-length genes in the region. Reads from the BSR-Seq experiment show that both genes are expressed in bulks of resistant progeny and not in susceptible progeny (Figure 2b), suggesting a putative role for these genes in causing resistance. ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are homologous genes with a high similarity (the predicted proteins that they encode share 97% amino acid identity). We compared the predicted amino acid sequences with previously characterised GTs and found that they share some similarity with GTs with a role in zeatin biosynthesis and with GAME17, an enzyme involved in biosynthesis of the SGA alpha-tomatine typically found in tomato (; Figure 2:figure supplement 8, Supplementary file 2).\nStudies on alpha-tomatine and avenacin A-1 show that changes to the sugar moiety of these saponins from tomato and oat, respectively, can affect their toxicity. Tomato and oat pathogens produce enzymes that can detoxify these compounds through removal of one or more glycosyl groups. The degradation products of saponins can also suppress plant defence responses. Conversely, here we show that the resistance of S. commersonii is based on the addition of a glycosyl group to a triose saponin from S. commersonii. There is large variation in both the aglycone and the sugar moiety of SGAs from wild Solanum, with likely over 100 distinct SGAs produced in tubers. This diversity suggests a pressure to evolve novel molecules, possibly to resist detoxification or other tolerance mechanisms, reminiscent of the molecular arms race that drives the evolution of plant immune receptors. Thus, wild Solanum germplasm is not only a rich source of immune receptors, it also provides a promising source of natural defence molecules. Studies of how pathogens that naturally occur on S. commersonii, or other Solanum species producing tetraose SGAs, can tolerate SGAs produced by their hosts could help judge the durability of this type of resistance."

			"context": "Solanum leaves usually contain SGAs, which are known phytoanticipins against fungi and other plant parasites. S. tuberosum typically produces the triose SGAs alpha-solanine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Rha) and alpha-chaconine (solanidine-Glu-Rha-Rha), while five major tetraose SGAs were previously identified in S. commersonii: commersonine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), dehydrocommersonine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), demissine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), dehydrodemissine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), and alpha-tomatine (tomatidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). To test if SGAs can explain resistance of S. commersonii, we measured SGA content in leaves from Atlantic and susceptible/resistant S. commersonii by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). As expected, we could detect the triose SGAs alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in susceptible S. tuberosum cv. Atlantic, but we found a remarkable difference in the SGA profile of resistant and susceptible S. commersonii. We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4). These results suggest that the triose SGAs present in susceptible CGN18024_3 are modified to produce the tetraose SGAs in resistant CGN18024_1, by addition of an extra glucose or xylose moiety."

			"context": "Solanum leaves usually contain SGAs, which are known phytoanticipins against fungi and other plant parasites. S. tuberosum typically produces the triose SGAs alpha-solanine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Rha) and alpha-chaconine (solanidine-Glu-Rha-Rha), while five major tetraose SGAs were previously identified in S. commersonii: commersonine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), dehydrocommersonine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), demissine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), dehydrodemissine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), and alpha-tomatine (tomatidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). To test if SGAs can explain resistance of S. commersonii, we measured SGA content in leaves from Atlantic and susceptible/resistant S. commersonii by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). As expected, we could detect the triose SGAs alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in susceptible S. tuberosum cv. Atlantic, but we found a remarkable difference in the SGA profile of resistant and susceptible S. commersonii. We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4). These results suggest that the triose SGAs present in susceptible CGN18024_3 are modified to produce the tetraose SGAs in resistant CGN18024_1, by addition of an extra glucose or xylose moiety."

			"context": "Biosynthesis of SGAs in Solanum is controlled by many genes. The discovery of S. commersonii genotypes with and without tetraose SGAs provides us with unique insight in the role of these compounds in plant immunity. Similar compounds are produced in Solanum species such as S. chacoense, S. chomatophilum, S. oplocense, S. paucisectum, and S. piurae, which may explain why these (or their descendants) display resistance to A. solani or CPB. The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato. The biosynthesis pathways leading to the production of these major SGAs from cultivated potato and tomato have largely been elucidated in recent years and it was found that the underlying genes occur in conserved clusters. This knowledge and the similarities between SGAs from S. commersonii and cultivated potato/tomato will help to identify the missing genes from the pathway through comparative genomics."
