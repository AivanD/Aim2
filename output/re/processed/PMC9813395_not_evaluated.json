			"context": "Gibberellic acids (GAs) are plant hormones with a wide range of developmental activities, including plant elongation. GA-deficient plants were significantly shorter than the WT, but their height was restored to WT levels by applying GA3. Recent progress has been made in identifying genes involved in GA metabolism and signaling pathways. GA biosynthesis involves a series of pathways in which metabolic enzymes interact. Copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), a terpene cyclase, catalyzes the first specific step of the GA biosynthesis pathway to produce ent-kaurene oxidase. Morphology of CPS overexpressing-transgenic rice show similar to the WT, despite increased expression of the ent-kaurene gene. Within the GA biosynthesis pathway, dioxygenases are important for providing GA for various developmental processes, and the total biosynthesis of bioactive GA is ultimately controlled by the dioxygenases GA3ox and GA20ox. Different expression patterns of GA20ox contribute to phenotypic variation in Arabidopsis, with GA20ox overexpression increasing the production of bioactive GAs, which influence plant growth. In rice, meanwhile, functionally deficient mutants of GA20ox show a typical dwarf phenotype."

			"context": "GAs are closely related to plant growth processes, such as seed and flower development, leaf expansion, and shoot elongation. We therefore analyzed OsGASD expression in response to GA, finding that it increased in shoots (but not roots) in response to GA treatment ( Figure 2 ,  S2 ). In addition, plant height and the lengths of panicles and internodes in the osgasd Ko mutant were restored to WT levels in response to GA treatment ( Figures 2B-F ). Furthermore, the shoots of OsGASD Ox plants had higher GA3 contents than WT shoots, whereas the shoots of the osgasd Ko mutant had lower GA3 content than WT shoots. However, GA3 contents in the roots of both OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko plants were similar to those of WT plants ( Figures 3A, B ). These results suggest that OsGASD is involved in GA biosynthesis in rice shoots. In Arabidopsis, both AtCPS- and AtCPS/AtKS-overexpressing transgenic plants showed increased accumulation of ent-kaurene and ent-kaurenoic acid, two early intermediates in the GA biosynthetic pathway, but normal levels of bioactive GA. Here, we analyzed the expression of key genes involved in GA biosynthesis, such CPS, KS, KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2. Whereas KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2 were upregulated in the shoots of young OsGASD Ox plants, the expression of CPS and KS was not significantly altered ( Figure 3C ). These results indicate that OsGASD mediates the accumulation of bioactive GA in young shoots during development.\nAnalysis of GA3 concentrations and GA biosynthesis genes expression in osgasd knockout mutant and OsGASD-overexpressing transgenic plants. (A, B) GA3 concentrations were measured in the shoots (A) and roots (B) of Ko, Ox and WT plants grown on MS media for 30 days. (C) RT-qPCR analysis shows changes in transcriptional expression levels in shoot of Ko, Ox and WT plants.

The plant height of 14-week-old osgasd Ko mutants increased with increasing GA3 concentration, with the height of the osgasd Ko plants treated with 10 ppm GA3 being restored to level similar to those of WT plants ( Figures 2C, D ). We also analyzed internode elongation, panicle length, and tiller number in the osgasd Ko mutant ( Figures 2E, F ). With increasing GA3 concentration, the lengths of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth internodes in the mutant increased, while the panicle length was not significantly altered, and the tiller number decreased. These results, together with the expression pattern of OsGASD and the GA sensitivity of the osgasd Ko mutant, suggest that OsGASD function is related to GA biosynthesis during plant growth."

Actin-related proteins (ARPs) also play central roles in plant growth, including cell elongation and development. However, the relationships between ARPs and GA signaling and biosynthesis are not fully understood. Here, we isolated OsGASD, encoding an ARP subunit from rice (Oryza sativa), using the Ac/Ds knockout system. The osgasd knockout (Ko) mutation reduced GA3 content in shoots as well as plant growth and height. However, GA application restored the plant height of the osgasd Ko mutant to a height similar to that of the wild type (WT). Rice plants overexpressing OsGASD (Ox) showed increased plant height and grain yield compared to the WT. Transcriptome analysis of flag leaves of OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko plants revealed that OsGASD regulates cell development and the expression of elongation-related genes. These observations suggest that OsGASD is involved in maintaining GA homeostasis to regulate plant development, thereby affecting rice growth and productivity."

By analyzing these mutants, we identified a novel gene encoding the ARPC2 subunit, which we named gibberellic acid sensitive dwarf (GASD). To investigate the role of OsGASD in plant development, we performed phenotypic and transcriptomic analysis of OsGASD-overexpressing (Ox) and OsGASD knockout (Ko) plants. Based on our findings, we propose that OsGASD is involved in the GA biosynthetic pathway and plays important roles in regulating plant growth and productivity. Our findings also shed light on the interactions between ARP genes and GAs."

To further explore rice productivity, we analyzed agronomic traits including the number of panicles, filling rate, number of spikelets per panicle, total grain weight, and 1,000-grain weight ( Figures 4G-K ;  Table S1 ). The number of panicles was approximately 40% lower in the osgasd Ko mutants compared to the WT plants. However, the number of panicles was not significantly elevated in OsGASD Ox plants. Total grain weight, the number of filled grains, and 1,000-grain weight of OsGASD Ox plants increased by approximately 27%, 30% and 13%, respectively, compared to WT plants. However, the filling rate was reduced in OsGASD Ox plants compared to WT plants. By contrast, the osgasd Ko mutants showed reduced values for all parameters compared to WT plants. Consequently, the total grain weight and total number of filled grains were higher in OsGASD Ox plants, but lower in osgasd Ko plants, compared to WT plants. Furthermore, the seed size and 1,000-grain weight differed among lines ( Figures 4K, L ). These results suggest that the increased grain yield in OsGASD Ox is largely due to increases in panicle length, number of filled grains, and grain weight, supporting the notion that the expression of OsGASD affects the development of seeds that form in the panicle."
