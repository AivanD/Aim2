We thus searched the MS/MS data across all species to identify hydroxyacyl chains of all lengths with the three types of sugars previously reported in RGs, namely pentoses (xylose), deoxyhexoses (rhamnose, fucose, quinovose), and hexoses (glucose) in RGs (Fig. 3B). Most RG peaks had the above-noted m/z peak association; however, a substantial number were also associated with a hexose, which most likely is glucose. The relative frequencies of pentose vs. deoxyhexose vs. hexose were species-dependent. Many Convolvulus and Calystegia species produced >20 RGs with deoxyhexose and pentose as the most and second-most frequent sugars, respectively, while the Merremia and Ipomoea species contained deoxyhexose and hexose (Fig. 3B). Previously identified RGs from Calystegia show the hydroxyacyl macrolactone ring connected to a glucose (a hexose) and quinovose (a deoxyhexose). Since the sugar-hydroxyacyl paired fragment in our study detects only one end of the macrolactone ring connection, the glycosidic linkage between deoxyhexose and the hydroxyacyl chain may be more stable than the ester linkage with hexose in electrospray ionization and collision-induced dissociation in LC-MS. Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the two Operculina species and Xenostegia tridentata had hexose instead of deoxyhexose or pentose as their most preferred sugar for adding the hydroxyacyl chain. Eight previously published structures from Operculina macrocarpa and Operculina turpethum with the hydroxyacyl chain bonded to glucose agree with this finding. Based on these observations, we infer that hydroxyacyl chain addition (or at least the glycosidic bond formation) with deoxyhexoses was likely the ancestral state for RG biosynthesis, with lineage-specific shifts to hexose or pentose. The mechanism of this addition is not clear."

A novel RG from Dichondra argentea was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, supporting previous observations of RGs with open hydroxyacyl chains instead of closed macrolactone ring structures. Substantial lineage-specific differentiation in utilization of sugars, hydroxyacyl chains, and decorating acyl chains was discovered, especially among Ipomoea and Convolvulus:the two largest genera in Convolvulaceae. Adopting a computational, knowledge-based strategy, we further developed a high-recall workflow that successfully explained ~72% of the MS/MS fragments, predicted the structural components of 11/13 previously characterized RGs, and partially annotated ~45% of the RGs. Overall, this study improves our understanding of phytochemical diversity and lays a foundation for characterizing the evolutionary mechanisms underlying RG diversification."

Many of these metabolite classes e.g. glucosinolates, alkaloids, terpenes, acylsugars, or cardenolides show lineage-specific structural diversification. Such specialized metabolites play important functional roles in plant pollination, defense, and resilience to abiotic stress conditions in the respective plants' ecological niche. One such class of specialized metabolites is acylsugars, which, in the Solanaceae family, are produced in the trichomes of many species. In Solanaceae, this class of anti-herbivory compounds comprises a sugar core (usually a sucrose but sometimes glucose or inositol) to which acyl chains derived from fatty acid or branched amino acid metabolism are esterified (Fig. 1A). A previous study catalogued acylsugar diversity across 40 species in the family, and identified some species, such as Salpiglossis sinuata and Nicotiana alata, that produce over 600 acylsugars on individual leaves. Acylsugars also show variation among individuals of the same species. This extreme structural diversity of acylsugars is hypothesized to occur due to the promiscuity of the BAHD acyltransferases involved in their biosynthesis, and the diverse precursor coenzyme A-activated acyl groups in the trichome metabolite pool."

Members of the horticulturally important morning glory (Convolvulaceae) family produce a diverse subclass of acylsugars called resin glycosides (RGs), which comprise oligosaccharide cores, hydroxyacyl chain(s), and decorating aliphatic and aromatic acyl chains. While many RG structures are characterized, the extent of structural diversity of this class in different genera and species is not known. In this study, we asked whether there has been lineage-specific diversification of RG structures in different Convolvulaceae species that may suggest diversification of the underlying biosynthetic pathways. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed from root and leaf extracts of 26 species sampled in a phylogeny-guided manner. LC-MS/MS revealed thousands of peaks with signature RG fragmentation patterns with one species producing over 300 signals, mirroring the diversity in Solanaceae-type acylsugars. A novel RG from Dichondra argentea was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, supporting previous observations of RGs with open hydroxyacyl chains instead of closed macrolactone ring structures. Substantial lineage-specific differentiation in utilization of sugars, hydroxyacyl chains, and decorating acyl chains was discovered, especially among Ipomoea and Convolvulus:the two largest genera in Convolvulaceae. Adopting a computational, knowledge-based strategy, we further developed a high-recall workflow that successfully explained ~72% of the MS/MS fragments, predicted the structural components of 11/13 previously characterized RGs, and partially annotated ~45% of the RGs. Overall, this study improves our understanding of phytochemical diversity and lays a foundation for characterizing the evolutionary mechanisms underlying RG diversification."

Such specialized metabolites play important functional roles in plant pollination, defense, and resilience to abiotic stress conditions in the respective plants' ecological niche. One such class of specialized metabolites is acylsugars, which, in the Solanaceae family, are produced in the trichomes of many species. In Solanaceae, this class of anti-herbivory compounds comprises a sugar core (usually a sucrose but sometimes glucose or inositol) to which acyl chains derived from fatty acid or branched amino acid metabolism are esterified (Fig. 1A). A previous study catalogued acylsugar diversity across 40 species in the family, and identified some species, such as Salpiglossis sinuata and Nicotiana alata, that produce over 600 acylsugars on individual leaves. Acylsugars also show variation among individuals of the same species. This extreme structural diversity of acylsugars is hypothesized to occur due to the promiscuity of the BAHD acyltransferases involved in their biosynthesis, and the diverse precursor coenzyme A-activated acyl groups in the trichome metabolite pool."

Two C. arvensis accessions collected from Yakima, in Washington State and Huntley, in Montana, USA that are ~800 miles apart produced 150 and 215 RGs, indicating genotype, environment or genotype x environment interactions in defining RG profiles. The fact that only 13/30 previously identified RGs could be detected in our study from the same species (Supplementary File 5) further supports this inference.

In this study, we asked whether there has been lineage-specific diversification of RG structures in different Convolvulaceae species that may suggest diversification of the underlying biosynthetic pathways. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed from root and leaf extracts of 26 species sampled in a phylogeny-guided manner. LC-MS/MS revealed thousands of peaks with signature RG fragmentation patterns with one species producing over 300 signals, mirroring the diversity in Solanaceae-type acylsugars. A novel RG from Dichondra argentea was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, supporting previous observations of RGs with open hydroxyacyl chains instead of closed macrolactone ring structures. Substantial lineage-specific differentiation in utilization of sugars, hydroxyacyl chains, and decorating acyl chains was discovered, especially among Ipomoea and Convolvulus:the two largest genera in Convolvulaceae. Adopting a computational, knowledge-based strategy, we further developed a high-recall workflow that successfully explained ~72% of the MS/MS fragments, predicted the structural components of 11/13 previously characterized RGs, and partially annotated ~45% of the RGs. Overall, this study improves our understanding of phytochemical diversity and lays a foundation for characterizing the evolutionary mechanisms underlying RG diversification."

A novel RG from Dichondra argentea was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, supporting previous observations of RGs with open hydroxyacyl chains instead of closed macrolactone ring structures. Substantial lineage-specific differentiation in utilization of sugars, hydroxyacyl chains, and decorating acyl chains was discovered, especially among Ipomoea and Convolvulus:the two largest genera in Convolvulaceae. Adopting a computational, knowledge-based strategy, we further developed a high-recall workflow that successfully explained ~72% of the MS/MS fragments, predicted the structural components of 11/13 previously characterized RGs, and partially annotated ~45% of the RGs. Overall, this study improves our understanding of phytochemical diversity and lays a foundation for characterizing the evolutionary mechanisms underlying RG diversification."

In Solanaceae, this class of anti-herbivory compounds comprises a sugar core (usually a sucrose but sometimes glucose or inositol) to which acyl chains derived from fatty acid or branched amino acid metabolism are esterified (Fig. 1A). A previous study catalogued acylsugar diversity across 40 species in the family, and identified some species, such as Salpiglossis sinuata and Nicotiana alata, that produce over 600 acylsugars on individual leaves. Acylsugars also show variation among individuals of the same species. This extreme structural diversity of acylsugars is hypothesized to occur due to the promiscuity of the BAHD acyltransferases involved in their biosynthesis, and the diverse precursor coenzyme A-activated acyl groups in the trichome metabolite pool."

Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B).

Most RG peaks had the above-noted m/z peak association; however, a substantial number were also associated with a hexose, which most likely is glucose. The relative frequencies of pentose vs. deoxyhexose vs. hexose were species-dependent. Many Convolvulus and Calystegia species produced >20 RGs with deoxyhexose and pentose as the most and second-most frequent sugars, respectively, while the Merremia and Ipomoea species contained deoxyhexose and hexose (Fig. 3B). Previously identified RGs from Calystegia show the hydroxyacyl macrolactone ring connected to a glucose (a hexose) and quinovose (a deoxyhexose). Since the sugar-hydroxyacyl paired fragment in our study detects only one end of the macrolactone ring connection, the glycosidic linkage between deoxyhexose and the hydroxyacyl chain may be more stable than the ester linkage with hexose in electrospray ionization and collision-induced dissociation in LC-MS. Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the two Operculina species and Xenostegia tridentata had hexose instead of deoxyhexose or pentose as their most preferred sugar for adding the hydroxyacyl chain. Eight previously published structures from Operculina macrocarpa and Operculina turpethum with the hydroxyacyl chain bonded to glucose agree with this finding. Based on these observations, we infer that hydroxyacyl chain addition (or at least the glycosidic bond formation) with deoxyhexoses was likely the ancestral state for RG biosynthesis, with lineage-specific shifts to hexose or pentose. The mechanism of this addition is not clear."

Many Convolvulus and Calystegia species produced >20 RGs with deoxyhexose and pentose as the most and second-most frequent sugars, respectively, while the Merremia and Ipomoea species contained deoxyhexose and hexose (Fig. 3B). Previously identified RGs from Calystegia show the hydroxyacyl macrolactone ring connected to a glucose (a hexose) and quinovose (a deoxyhexose). Since the sugar-hydroxyacyl paired fragment in our study detects only one end of the macrolactone ring connection, the glycosidic linkage between deoxyhexose and the hydroxyacyl chain may be more stable than the ester linkage with hexose in electrospray ionization and collision-induced dissociation in LC-MS. Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the two Operculina species and Xenostegia tridentata had hexose instead of deoxyhexose or pentose as their most preferred sugar for adding the hydroxyacyl chain. Eight previously published structures from Operculina macrocarpa and Operculina turpethum with the hydroxyacyl chain bonded to glucose agree with this finding. Based on these observations, we infer that hydroxyacyl chain addition (or at least the glycosidic bond formation) with deoxyhexoses was likely the ancestral state for RG biosynthesis, with lineage-specific shifts to hexose or pentose. The mechanism of this addition is not clear."

Given all these compound classes are technically acylsugars, we refer to Solanaceae acylsugars as \"Solanaceae-type acylsugars\" while referring to the combined class as \"acylsugars\" (Fig. 1). While the extent of the diversity of acylsugars across plants is not known, structures of another similar compound class:resin glycosides (RGs):have been extensively characterized in morning glories (Convolvulaceae) since their discovery in the 1990s (Fig. 1B). Over 300 RG structures have been characterized from several Convolvulaceae species using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (reviewed in), and they reveal three primary structural elements: (i) an oligosaccharide core of 2-7 sugars comprising pentoses, deoxyhexoses, and hexoses; (ii) a 14-18 carbon long hydroxy- or dihydroxy fatty acid that may form an intra-molecular macrolactone ring; and (iii) decorations of aromatic or aliphatic acyl side chains that can be 2-16 carbons long. Some RGs undergo intermolecular condensation to form larger, more complex units. RGs have also been extensively characterized functionally, with studies finding their roles in bacterial and fungal inhibition, in herbivory defense against nematodes and leaf herbivores as well as in allelopathic interactions. RGs are also responsible for the purgative properties of powders of Ipomoea purga root:which accumulate resin glycosides up to 20% of their root dry weight:and which are used in traditional Indian and Mexican medicine."

This observation strongly suggests that RGs are produced in the roots. It is not clear, however, whether RGs are also produced in the leaves or are simply transported there."

Previously identified RGs from Calystegia show the hydroxyacyl macrolactone ring connected to a glucose (a hexose) and quinovose (a deoxyhexose). Since the sugar-hydroxyacyl paired fragment in our study detects only one end of the macrolactone ring connection, the glycosidic linkage between deoxyhexose and the hydroxyacyl chain may be more stable than the ester linkage with hexose in electrospray ionization and collision-induced dissociation in LC-MS. Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B).

We thus searched the MS/MS data across all species to identify hydroxyacyl chains of all lengths with the three types of sugars previously reported in RGs, namely pentoses (xylose), deoxyhexoses (rhamnose, fucose, quinovose), and hexoses (glucose) in RGs (Fig. 3B). Most RG peaks had the above-noted m/z peak association; however, a substantial number were also associated with a hexose, which most likely is glucose. The relative frequencies of pentose vs. deoxyhexose vs. hexose were species-dependent. Many Convolvulus and Calystegia species produced >20 RGs with deoxyhexose and pentose as the most and second-most frequent sugars, respectively, while the Merremia and Ipomoea species contained deoxyhexose and hexose (Fig. 3B). Previously identified RGs from Calystegia show the hydroxyacyl macrolactone ring connected to a glucose (a hexose) and quinovose (a deoxyhexose). Since the sugar-hydroxyacyl paired fragment in our study detects only one end of the macrolactone ring connection, the glycosidic linkage between deoxyhexose and the hydroxyacyl chain may be more stable than the ester linkage with hexose in electrospray ionization and collision-induced dissociation in LC-MS. Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the two Operculina species and Xenostegia tridentata had hexose instead of deoxyhexose or pentose as their most preferred sugar for adding the hydroxyacyl chain. Eight previously published structures from Operculina macrocarpa and Operculina turpethum with the hydroxyacyl chain bonded to glucose agree with this finding. Based on these observations, we infer that hydroxyacyl chain addition (or at least the glycosidic bond formation) with deoxyhexoses was likely the ancestral state for RG biosynthesis, with lineage-specific shifts to hexose or pentose. The mechanism of this addition is not clear."

			"context": "Substantial diversity was found in RG structures in each plant, within species as well as between species. All species were found to accumulate RGs in the roots. Evidence of five different hydroxyacyl groups complexed with sugars with occurrence in >10 RGs was obtained, with C16-OH being the most common (Fig. 3C). This was followed by hydroxyacyl chains of C15, C17 length, and then by C16-OHOH. Odd-chain fatty acids (C15, C17) are rarer compared to even-chain ones; however, both have previously been described in RGs. In addition, hydroxylated C17 fatty acid is the second most prevalent macrolactone ring fatty acid except in C. arvensis Yakima, which preferred C15 as the alternate chain. Biosynthesis of odd-chain fatty acids has been proposed to occur (i) from propionyl coA as the primer in fatty acid elongation pathway instead of acetyl coA, (ii) via one carbon elongation of fatty acids e.g. in acylsugars, and (iii) alpha oxidation of the more abundant even-chain fatty acids, but which of these mechanisms is prevalent in morning glories is unknown. These observations:combined with the unusual 11th position hydroxylation in the hydroxyacyl chain:reveal the unique biochemistry of RGs. 12-Hydroxyhexadecanoic acid and 11(S)-hydroxyheptadecanoic acid have been previously documented in O. turpethum and C. arvensis, respectively, but our study reveals the previously unreported extent of hydroxyheptadecanoic acid's prevalence across the Convolvulaceae RGs. Furthermore, based on the chain distribution patterns (Fig. 3C), we predict that a single enzyme:preferring jalapinolic acid and with promiscuous activities with other hydroxy/dihydroxy acyl chains:is responsible for acylation of the oligosaccharide core."

We thus searched the MS/MS data across all species to identify hydroxyacyl chains of all lengths with the three types of sugars previously reported in RGs, namely pentoses (xylose), deoxyhexoses (rhamnose, fucose, quinovose), and hexoses (glucose) in RGs (Fig. 3B). Most RG peaks had the above-noted m/z peak association; however, a substantial number were also associated with a hexose, which most likely is glucose. The relative frequencies of pentose vs. deoxyhexose vs. hexose were species-dependent. Many Convolvulus and Calystegia species produced >20 RGs with deoxyhexose and pentose as the most and second-most frequent sugars, respectively, while the Merremia and Ipomoea species contained deoxyhexose and hexose (Fig. 3B). Previously identified RGs from Calystegia show the hydroxyacyl macrolactone ring connected to a glucose (a hexose) and quinovose (a deoxyhexose). Since the sugar-hydroxyacyl paired fragment in our study detects only one end of the macrolactone ring connection, the glycosidic linkage between deoxyhexose and the hydroxyacyl chain may be more stable than the ester linkage with hexose in electrospray ionization and collision-induced dissociation in LC-MS. Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the two Operculina species and Xenostegia tridentata had hexose instead of deoxyhexose or pentose as their most preferred sugar for adding the hydroxyacyl chain. Eight previously published structures from Operculina macrocarpa and Operculina turpethum with the hydroxyacyl chain bonded to glucose agree with this finding. Based on these observations, we infer that hydroxyacyl chain addition (or at least the glycosidic bond formation) with deoxyhexoses was likely the ancestral state for RG biosynthesis, with lineage-specific shifts to hexose or pentose. The mechanism of this addition is not clear."

A total of 2100 RGs (78.1% of detected RGs) were clustered into a single large network, and these were displayed using genus-level occurrence patterns (Fig. 4). We found large, centrally located regions 1 and 2, comprising fragmentation spectra shared by multiple genera. The greatest difference was seen between Ipomoea and Convolvulus:although these genera shared peaks in regions 1 and 2, dozens of unique RGs were found in regions 4, 6, 7 (Convolvulus) and region 3 (Ipomoea). These observations suggest fixed lineage-specific differences between the major genera. Analysis of the pseudo-molecular ion masses (Fig. 4B) revealed that Convolvulus produced hundreds of high molecular RGs with m/z > 1500 while Ipomoea species produced many low molecular weight RGs not observed in other species. This finding agrees with previously reported RGs from C. arvensis, containing many penta-, hexa-, and hepta-saccharides vs. predominantly tri- and tetra-saccharides from Ipomoea species. Above results (Fig. 3D) showing differential acyl chain patterns in Ipomoea vs. Convolvulus may also contribute to overall spectral divergence."

The relative frequencies of pentose vs. deoxyhexose vs. hexose were species-dependent. Many Convolvulus and Calystegia species produced >20 RGs with deoxyhexose and pentose as the most and second-most frequent sugars, respectively, while the Merremia and Ipomoea species contained deoxyhexose and hexose (Fig. 3B). Previously identified RGs from Calystegia show the hydroxyacyl macrolactone ring connected to a glucose (a hexose) and quinovose (a deoxyhexose). Since the sugar-hydroxyacyl paired fragment in our study detects only one end of the macrolactone ring connection, the glycosidic linkage between deoxyhexose and the hydroxyacyl chain may be more stable than the ester linkage with hexose in electrospray ionization and collision-induced dissociation in LC-MS. Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the two Operculina species and Xenostegia tridentata had hexose instead of deoxyhexose or pentose as their most preferred sugar for adding the hydroxyacyl chain. Eight previously published structures from Operculina macrocarpa and Operculina turpethum with the hydroxyacyl chain bonded to glucose agree with this finding. Based on these observations, we infer that hydroxyacyl chain addition (or at least the glycosidic bond formation) with deoxyhexoses was likely the ancestral state for RG biosynthesis, with lineage-specific shifts to hexose or pentose.

			"context": "To further confirm the detection of RGs, we purified and structurally elucidated one highly abundant predicted RG peak with [M-H]- m/z 1279.67, from D. argentea Silver Falls using NMR. Its molecular formula was determined to be C62H104O27, with the structure comprising a fucose, two glucoses, and a rhamnose (Fig. 2C, Supplementary Table 1; Supplementary Fig. 5). The jalapinolic acid moiety was found to be in an open structure instead of in a macrolactone ring. Previous RGs identified from Dichondra repens were also found to contain two rhamnoses and glucoses (Dichondrin A, B) or two rhamnoses and one glucose (Dichondrin C), both with open hydroxyacyl chain instead of a macrolactone ring. We thus call this structure Dichondrin D. The MS/MS fragmentation pattern of Dichondrin D could be explained by the characterized structure (Supplementary Fig. 6). This result further confirmed that the fragmentation patterns being assessed were from true RGs.\nThe MS/MS peak m/z = 271.2279 co-occurs with m/z = 417.2854 (Supplementary Fig. 4), which corresponds to C16-OH bonded to a deoxyhexose.

Previously identified RGs from Calystegia show the hydroxyacyl macrolactone ring connected to a glucose (a hexose) and quinovose (a deoxyhexose). Since the sugar-hydroxyacyl paired fragment in our study detects only one end of the macrolactone ring connection, the glycosidic linkage between deoxyhexose and the hydroxyacyl chain may be more stable than the ester linkage with hexose in electrospray ionization and collision-induced dissociation in LC-MS. Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the two Operculina species and Xenostegia tridentata had hexose instead of deoxyhexose or pentose as their most preferred sugar for adding the hydroxyacyl chain. Eight previously published structures from Operculina macrocarpa and Operculina turpethum with the hydroxyacyl chain bonded to glucose agree with this finding. Based on these observations, we infer that hydroxyacyl chain addition (or at least the glycosidic bond formation) with deoxyhexoses was likely the ancestral state for RG biosynthesis, with lineage-specific shifts to hexose or pentose.

Biosynthesis of odd-chain fatty acids has been proposed to occur (i) from propionyl coA as the primer in fatty acid elongation pathway instead of acetyl coA, (ii) via one carbon elongation of fatty acids e.g. in acylsugars, and (iii) alpha oxidation of the more abundant even-chain fatty acids, but which of these mechanisms is prevalent in morning glories is unknown. These observations:combined with the unusual 11th position hydroxylation in the hydroxyacyl chain:reveal the unique biochemistry of RGs. 12-Hydroxyhexadecanoic acid and 11(S)-hydroxyheptadecanoic acid have been previously documented in O. turpethum and C. arvensis, respectively, but our study reveals the previously unreported extent of hydroxyheptadecanoic acid's prevalence across the Convolvulaceae RGs. Furthermore, based on the chain distribution patterns (Fig. 3C), we predict that a single enzyme:preferring jalapinolic acid and with promiscuous activities with other hydroxy/dihydroxy acyl chains:is responsible for acylation of the oligosaccharide core."
