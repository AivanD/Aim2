			"justification": "A novel RG from Dichondra argentea was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy",
			"context": "Acylsugars are a class of plant defense compounds produced across many distantly related families. Members of the horticulturally important morning glory (Convolvulaceae) family produce a diverse subclass of acylsugars called resin glycosides (RGs), which comprise oligosaccharide cores, hydroxyacyl chain(s), and decorating aliphatic and aromatic acyl chains. While many RG structures are characterized, the extent of structural diversity of this class in different genera and species is not known. In this study, we asked whether there has been lineage-specific diversification of RG structures in different Convolvulaceae species that may suggest diversification of the underlying biosynthetic pathways. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was performed from root and leaf extracts of 26 species sampled in a phylogeny-guided manner. LC-MS/MS revealed thousands of peaks with signature RG fragmentation patterns with one species producing over 300 signals, mirroring the diversity in Solanaceae-type acylsugars. A novel RG from Dichondra argentea was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, supporting previous observations of RGs with open hydroxyacyl chains instead of closed macrolactone ring structures. Substantial lineage-specific differentiation in utilization of sugars, hydroxyacyl chains, and decorating acyl chains was discovered, especially among Ipomoea and Convolvulus:the two largest genera in Convolvulaceae. Adopting a computational, knowledge-based strategy, we further developed a high-recall workflow that successfully explained ~72% of the MS/MS fragments, predicted the structural components of 11/13 previously characterized RGs, and partially annotated ~45% of the RGs. Overall, this study improves our understanding of phytochemical diversity and lays a foundation for characterizing the evolutionary mechanisms underlying RG diversification."

Over 300 RG signals were found in Convolvulus equitans:the most among all plants sampled, while an unidentified Convolvulus/Calystegia species produced only 20 RGs. Two C. arvensis accessions collected from Yakima, in Washington State and Huntley, in Montana, USA that are ~800 miles apart produced 150 and 215 RGs, indicating genotype, environment or genotype x environment interactions in defining RG profiles. The fact that only 13/30 previously identified RGs could be detected in our study from the same species (Supplementary File 5) further supports this inference. Such population-level diversity has previously also been documented among Solanaceae-type acylsugars in populations of Solanum habrochaites and Solanum pennellii."

(B) Number of RG peaks with neutral loss corresponding to pentose, deoxyhexose, or hexose groups typically seen attached to the hydroxyacyl chain involved with macrolactone ring formation. (C) Number of RG peaks with MS/MS fragments corresponding to the estimated masses of the different hydroxy- and dihydroxyacyl fragments. Some RG peaks had more than one fragment, as shown in the last three columns. (D) Percentage of RG peaks having a given acyl chain out of all RG peaks in that species with an acyl chain prediction. Numbers do not add up to 100 since each RG may have multiple acyl chain predictions. The percentages provide an idea of the general trend of acyl chain usage in a given species. Inference of the acetic acid group is based on neutral loss while other inferences are based on observation of specific MS/MS fragments. Monoisotopic [M-H]- acyl masses that cannot be confidently assigned to known acyl chain fragments are noted."

A previous study catalogued acylsugar diversity across 40 species in the family, and identified some species, such as Salpiglossis sinuata and Nicotiana alata, that produce over 600 acylsugars on individual leaves. Acylsugars also show variation among individuals of the same species. This extreme structural diversity of acylsugars is hypothesized to occur due to the promiscuity of the BAHD acyltransferases involved in their biosynthesis, and the diverse precursor coenzyme A-activated acyl groups in the trichome metabolite pool."

			"context": "While \"acylsugars\" commonly refers to the class of compounds that is known to be restricted only to members of the Solanaceae family, other structurally and possibly biosynthetically analogous acylated sugar compounds are also documented across the plant kingdom. For example, Ibicella lutea (Martyniaceae), Silene gallica (Caryophyllaceae), Cerastium glomeratum (Caryophyllaceae), and Geranium carolinianum (Geraniaceae) are also known to produce acylated sugar compounds (Fig. 1C-E). In the known examples, the central sugar in these compounds is a glucose, with acyl or hydroxyacyl chains attached via ester and/or ether linkages. Given all these compound classes are technically acylsugars, we refer to Solanaceae acylsugars as \"Solanaceae-type acylsugars\" while referring to the combined class as \"acylsugars\" (Fig. 1). While the extent of the diversity of acylsugars across plants is not known, structures of another similar compound class:resin glycosides (RGs):have been extensively characterized in morning glories (Convolvulaceae) since their discovery in the 1990s (Fig. 1B). Over 300 RG structures have been characterized from several Convolvulaceae species using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (reviewed in), and they reveal three primary structural elements: (i) an oligosaccharide core of 2-7 sugars comprising pentoses, deoxyhexoses, and hexoses; (ii) a 14-18 carbon long hydroxy- or dihydroxy fatty acid that may form an intra-molecular macrolactone ring; and (iii) decorations of aromatic or aliphatic acyl side chains that can be 2-16 carbons long. Some RGs undergo intermolecular condensation to form larger, more complex units. RGs have also been extensively characterized functionally, with studies finding their roles in bacterial and fungal inhibition, in herbivory defense against nematodes and leaf herbivores as well as in allelopathic interactions. RGs are also responsible for the purgative properties of powders of Ipomoea purga root:which accumulate resin glycosides up to 20% of their root dry weight:and which are used in traditional Indian and Mexican medicine."

Over 300 RG structures have been characterized from several Convolvulaceae species using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (reviewed in), and they reveal three primary structural elements: (i) an oligosaccharide core of 2-7 sugars comprising pentoses, deoxyhexoses, and hexoses; (ii) a 14-18 carbon long hydroxy- or dihydroxy fatty acid that may form an intra-molecular macrolactone ring; and (iii) decorations of aromatic or aliphatic acyl side chains that can be 2-16 carbons long. Some RGs undergo intermolecular condensation to form larger, more complex units. RGs have also been extensively characterized functionally, with studies finding their roles in bacterial and fungal inhibition, in herbivory defense against nematodes and leaf herbivores as well as in allelopathic interactions. RGs are also responsible for the purgative properties of powders of Ipomoea purga root:which accumulate resin glycosides up to 20% of their root dry weight:and which are used in traditional Indian and Mexican medicine."

Most RG peaks had the above-noted m/z peak association; however, a substantial number were also associated with a hexose, which most likely is glucose. The relative frequencies of pentose vs. deoxyhexose vs. hexose were species-dependent. Many Convolvulus and Calystegia species produced >20 RGs with deoxyhexose and pentose as the most and second-most frequent sugars, respectively, while the Merremia and Ipomoea species contained deoxyhexose and hexose (Fig. 3B). Previously identified RGs from Calystegia show the hydroxyacyl macrolactone ring connected to a glucose (a hexose) and quinovose (a deoxyhexose). Since the sugar-hydroxyacyl paired fragment in our study detects only one end of the macrolactone ring connection, the glycosidic linkage between deoxyhexose and the hydroxyacyl chain may be more stable than the ester linkage with hexose in electrospray ionization and collision-induced dissociation in LC-MS. Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the two Operculina species and Xenostegia tridentata had hexose instead of deoxyhexose or pentose as their most preferred sugar for adding the hydroxyacyl chain. Eight previously published structures from Operculina macrocarpa and Operculina turpethum with the hydroxyacyl chain bonded to glucose agree with this finding. Based on these observations, we infer that hydroxyacyl chain addition (or at least the glycosidic bond formation) with deoxyhexoses was likely the ancestral state for RG biosynthesis, with lineage-specific shifts to hexose or pentose.

We thus searched the MS/MS data across all species to identify hydroxyacyl chains of all lengths with the three types of sugars previously reported in RGs, namely pentoses (xylose), deoxyhexoses (rhamnose, fucose, quinovose), and hexoses (glucose) in RGs (Fig. 3B). Most RG peaks had the above-noted m/z peak association; however, a substantial number were also associated with a hexose, which most likely is glucose. The relative frequencies of pentose vs. deoxyhexose vs. hexose were species-dependent. Many Convolvulus and Calystegia species produced >20 RGs with deoxyhexose and pentose as the most and second-most frequent sugars, respectively, while the Merremia and Ipomoea species contained deoxyhexose and hexose (Fig. 3B). Previously identified RGs from Calystegia show the hydroxyacyl macrolactone ring connected to a glucose (a hexose) and quinovose (a deoxyhexose). Since the sugar-hydroxyacyl paired fragment in our study detects only one end of the macrolactone ring connection, the glycosidic linkage between deoxyhexose and the hydroxyacyl chain may be more stable than the ester linkage with hexose in electrospray ionization and collision-induced dissociation in LC-MS. Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the two Operculina species and Xenostegia tridentata had hexose instead of deoxyhexose or pentose as their most preferred sugar for adding the hydroxyacyl chain. Eight previously published structures from Operculina macrocarpa and Operculina turpethum with the hydroxyacyl chain bonded to glucose agree with this finding. Based on these observations, we infer that hydroxyacyl chain addition (or at least the glycosidic bond formation) with deoxyhexoses was likely the ancestral state for RG biosynthesis, with lineage-specific shifts to hexose or pentose. The mechanism of this addition is not clear."

Based on these observations, we infer that hydroxyacyl chain addition (or at least the glycosidic bond formation) with deoxyhexoses was likely the ancestral state for RG biosynthesis, with lineage-specific shifts to hexose or pentose. The mechanism of this addition is not clear."

We thus searched the MS/MS data across all species to identify hydroxyacyl chains of all lengths with the three types of sugars previously reported in RGs, namely pentoses (xylose), deoxyhexoses (rhamnose, fucose, quinovose), and hexoses (glucose) in RGs (Fig. 3B). Most RG peaks had the above-noted m/z peak association; however, a substantial number were also associated with a hexose, which most likely is glucose. The relative frequencies of pentose vs. deoxyhexose vs. hexose were species-dependent. Many Convolvulus and Calystegia species produced >20 RGs with deoxyhexose and pentose as the most and second-most frequent sugars, respectively, while the Merremia and Ipomoea species contained deoxyhexose and hexose (Fig. 3B). Previously identified RGs from Calystegia show the hydroxyacyl macrolactone ring connected to a glucose (a hexose) and quinovose (a deoxyhexose). Since the sugar-hydroxyacyl paired fragment in our study detects only one end of the macrolactone ring connection, the glycosidic linkage between deoxyhexose and the hydroxyacyl chain may be more stable than the ester linkage with hexose in electrospray ionization and collision-induced dissociation in LC-MS. Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the two Operculina species and Xenostegia tridentata had hexose instead of deoxyhexose or pentose as their most preferred sugar for adding the hydroxyacyl chain. Eight previously published structures from Operculina macrocarpa and Operculina turpethum with the hydroxyacyl chain bonded to glucose agree with this finding.

Longer saturated acyl chains were not as frequently detected, indicating the predominant role of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis:from which most of the small acyl chains are likely derived:in RG decorations. Such diverse acylations are indicative of the involvement of BAHDs, similar to the promiscuous BAHDs of the Solanaceae acylsugar biosynthetic pathway. Solanaceae-type acylsugar BAHDs as well as anthocyanin sugar acylating BAHDs show conservation of acylation positions in orthologs despite their acceptor promiscuity; however, in RGs, analysis of previously characterized structures does not suggest positional uniformity. Nonetheless, the diversity of acyl chains added to RGs and the variable positions suggests the involvement of one promiscuous or multiple BAHDs in the process. Lineage-specific allelic divergence or gains/losses of the BAHDs may produce the observed lineage-specific patterns of acylation."

Longer saturated acyl chains were not as frequently detected, indicating the predominant role of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis:from which most of the small acyl chains are likely derived:in RG decorations. Such diverse acylations are indicative of the involvement of BAHDs, similar to the promiscuous BAHDs of the Solanaceae acylsugar biosynthetic pathway. Solanaceae-type acylsugar BAHDs as well as anthocyanin sugar acylating BAHDs show conservation of acylation positions in orthologs despite their acceptor promiscuity; however, in RGs, analysis of previously characterized structures does not suggest positional uniformity. Nonetheless, the diversity of acyl chains added to RGs and the variable positions suggests the involvement of one promiscuous or multiple BAHDs in the process. Lineage-specific allelic divergence or gains/losses of the BAHDs may produce the observed lineage-specific patterns of acylation."

Three types of peaks showed frequent co-occurrences: (i) the hydroxyacyl fragment + one and two sugar (typically, 271-417-561/579); (ii) formate adduct (-46) or CO2 (-44) losses paired with a specific MS/MS fragment; and (iii) water (-18) loss (Fig. 5). This water loss could arise from an open or closed macrolactone ring structure:both forms are found in diverse RG structures across Convolvulaceae and in our NMR results (Fig. 2):or via a dehydration-led rearrangement occurring during electrospray ionization (Fig. 5)."

Longer saturated acyl chains were not as frequently detected, indicating the predominant role of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis:from which most of the small acyl chains are likely derived:in RG decorations. Such diverse acylations are indicative of the involvement of BAHDs, similar to the promiscuous BAHDs of the Solanaceae acylsugar biosynthetic pathway. Solanaceae-type acylsugar BAHDs as well as anthocyanin sugar acylating BAHDs show conservation of acylation positions in orthologs despite their acceptor promiscuity; however, in RGs, analysis of previously characterized structures does not suggest positional uniformity. Nonetheless, the diversity of acyl chains added to RGs and the variable positions suggests the involvement of one promiscuous or multiple BAHDs in the process. Lineage-specific allelic divergence or gains/losses of the BAHDs may produce the observed lineage-specific patterns of acylation."

This inadequacy results in a vast proportion of the plant metabolome remaining unannotated, which can further create roadblocks in annotating the genes involved in metabolism. Here, we used the knowledge of fragmentation patterns in RGs to annotate their structural components. Such a knowledge-based approach is popularly used in lipid annotation by tools such as LipidBlast, whose internal database contains in silico fragmentation for >120 000 lipids from 30 structural classes. Recently, a deep learning method CANOPUS was developed to predict metabolite classes using untargeted LC-MS/MS data. This approach was used to predict hundreds of flavonoids and anthocyanins in sweet potatoes; however, more algorithmic development is needed for other phytochemical classes. Furthermore, much of the specialized metabolic diversity lies outside of current reference species that are the most well studied. Thus, approaches to rapidly annotate this \"non-model diversity\" are needed. The knowledge-based approach developed here for RGs provides a template for other acylsugars across the plant kingdom (Fig. 1). Given the bonds remain generally the same:glycosidic, ester, and ether linkages:we predict that the fragmentation pattern would be consistently reproducible if using comparable MS methodology. Overall, the findings presented here not only provide an extensive insight into the unique chemistry and diversification of RGs in Convolvulaceae:a horticulturally important family:but also provide a foundation for using the lineage-specific variation to probe the biochemistry of these compounds in the future."
