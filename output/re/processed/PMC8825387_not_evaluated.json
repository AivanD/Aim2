Evidence of five different hydroxyacyl groups complexed with sugars with occurrence in >10 RGs was obtained, with C16-OH being the most common (Fig. 3C). This was followed by hydroxyacyl chains of C15, C17 length, and then by C16-OHOH. Odd-chain fatty acids (C15, C17) are rarer compared to even-chain ones; however, both have previously been described in RGs. In addition, hydroxylated C17 fatty acid is the second most prevalent macrolactone ring fatty acid except in C. arvensis Yakima, which preferred C15 as the alternate chain. Biosynthesis of odd-chain fatty acids has been proposed to occur (i) from propionyl coA as the primer in fatty acid elongation pathway instead of acetyl coA, (ii) via one carbon elongation of fatty acids e.g. in acylsugars, and (iii) alpha oxidation of the more abundant even-chain fatty acids, but which of these mechanisms is prevalent in morning glories is unknown. These observations:combined with the unusual 11th position hydroxylation in the hydroxyacyl chain:reveal the unique biochemistry of RGs. 12-Hydroxyhexadecanoic acid and 11(S)-hydroxyheptadecanoic acid have been previously documented in O. turpethum and C. arvensis, respectively, but our study reveals the previously unreported extent of hydroxyheptadecanoic acid's prevalence across the Convolvulaceae RGs. Furthermore, based on the chain distribution patterns (Fig. 3C), we predict that a single enzyme:preferring jalapinolic acid and with promiscuous activities with other hydroxy/dihydroxy acyl chains:is responsible for acylation of the oligosaccharide core."

Thus, consistency of growth stage and conditions:which is impossible when sampling 26 globally distributed species with variable growth habits and evolutionary adaptations to different environments:was not maintained. Exploratory analysis revealed substantial profile diversity for jalapinolic acid (11-hydroxyhexadecanoic acid; C16-OH; m/z = 271.2279)-containing compounds (Fig. 2A and B; Supplementary Fig. 2A-D), which may indicate species-specific RG patterns."

Most RG peaks had the above-noted m/z peak association; however, a substantial number were also associated with a hexose, which most likely is glucose. The relative frequencies of pentose vs. deoxyhexose vs. hexose were species-dependent. Many Convolvulus and Calystegia species produced >20 RGs with deoxyhexose and pentose as the most and second-most frequent sugars, respectively, while the Merremia and Ipomoea species contained deoxyhexose and hexose (Fig. 3B). Previously identified RGs from Calystegia show the hydroxyacyl macrolactone ring connected to a glucose (a hexose) and quinovose (a deoxyhexose). Since the sugar-hydroxyacyl paired fragment in our study detects only one end of the macrolactone ring connection, the glycosidic linkage between deoxyhexose and the hydroxyacyl chain may be more stable than the ester linkage with hexose in electrospray ionization and collision-induced dissociation in LC-MS. Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the two Operculina species and Xenostegia tridentata had hexose instead of deoxyhexose or pentose as their most preferred sugar for adding the hydroxyacyl chain. Eight previously published structures from Operculina macrocarpa and Operculina turpethum with the hydroxyacyl chain bonded to glucose agree with this finding. Based on these observations, we infer that hydroxyacyl chain addition (or at least the glycosidic bond formation) with deoxyhexoses was likely the ancestral state for RG biosynthesis, with lineage-specific shifts to hexose or pentose. The mechanism of this addition is not clear."

We thus searched the MS/MS data across all species to identify hydroxyacyl chains of all lengths with the three types of sugars previously reported in RGs, namely pentoses (xylose), deoxyhexoses (rhamnose, fucose, quinovose), and hexoses (glucose) in RGs (Fig. 3B). Most RG peaks had the above-noted m/z peak association; however, a substantial number were also associated with a hexose, which most likely is glucose. The relative frequencies of pentose vs. deoxyhexose vs. hexose were species-dependent. Many Convolvulus and Calystegia species produced >20 RGs with deoxyhexose and pentose as the most and second-most frequent sugars, respectively, while the Merremia and Ipomoea species contained deoxyhexose and hexose (Fig. 3B). Previously identified RGs from Calystegia show the hydroxyacyl macrolactone ring connected to a glucose (a hexose) and quinovose (a deoxyhexose). Since the sugar-hydroxyacyl paired fragment in our study detects only one end of the macrolactone ring connection, the glycosidic linkage between deoxyhexose and the hydroxyacyl chain may be more stable than the ester linkage with hexose in electrospray ionization and collision-induced dissociation in LC-MS. Both pentose and hexose were equally frequent in D. argentea as an alternative sugar (Fig. 3B). In contrast, the two Operculina species and Xenostegia tridentata had hexose instead of deoxyhexose or pentose as their most preferred sugar for adding the hydroxyacyl chain. Eight previously published structures from Operculina macrocarpa and Operculina turpethum with the hydroxyacyl chain bonded to glucose agree with this finding. Based on these observations, we infer that hydroxyacyl chain addition (or at least the glycosidic bond formation) with deoxyhexoses was likely the ancestral state for RG biosynthesis, with lineage-specific shifts to hexose or pentose. The mechanism of this addition is not clear."

Evidence of five different hydroxyacyl groups complexed with sugars with occurrence in >10 RGs was obtained, with C16-OH being the most common (Fig. 3C). This was followed by hydroxyacyl chains of C15, C17 length, and then by C16-OHOH. Odd-chain fatty acids (C15, C17) are rarer compared to even-chain ones; however, both have previously been described in RGs. In addition, hydroxylated C17 fatty acid is the second most prevalent macrolactone ring fatty acid except in C. arvensis Yakima, which preferred C15 as the alternate chain. Biosynthesis of odd-chain fatty acids has been proposed to occur (i) from propionyl coA as the primer in fatty acid elongation pathway instead of acetyl coA, (ii) via one carbon elongation of fatty acids e.g. in acylsugars, and (iii) alpha oxidation of the more abundant even-chain fatty acids, but which of these mechanisms is prevalent in morning glories is unknown. These observations:combined with the unusual 11th position hydroxylation in the hydroxyacyl chain:reveal the unique biochemistry of RGs. 12-Hydroxyhexadecanoic acid and 11(S)-hydroxyheptadecanoic acid have been previously documented in O. turpethum and C. arvensis, respectively, but our study reveals the previously unreported extent of hydroxyheptadecanoic acid's prevalence across the Convolvulaceae RGs. Furthermore, based on the chain distribution patterns (Fig. 3C), we predict that a single enzyme:preferring jalapinolic acid and with promiscuous activities with other hydroxy/dihydroxy acyl chains:is responsible for acylation of the oligosaccharide core."

			"context": "Among the acyl chains, five-carbon long chains (e.g. valeric acid, 2-methylbutyric acid, 3-methylbutyric acid) were the most frequent while four-carbon moieties (e.g. isobutyric acid, n-butyric acid), tiglic and acetic were also found in >10% of the RGs. Longer saturated acyl chains were not as frequently detected, indicating the predominant role of branched chain amino acid biosynthesis:from which most of the small acyl chains are likely derived:in RG decorations. Such diverse acylations are indicative of the involvement of BAHDs, similar to the promiscuous BAHDs of the Solanaceae acylsugar biosynthetic pathway. Solanaceae-type acylsugar BAHDs as well as anthocyanin sugar acylating BAHDs show conservation of acylation positions in orthologs despite their acceptor promiscuity; however, in RGs, analysis of previously characterized structures does not suggest positional uniformity. Nonetheless, the diversity of acyl chains added to RGs and the variable positions suggests the involvement of one promiscuous or multiple BAHDs in the process. Lineage-specific allelic divergence or gains/losses of the BAHDs may produce the observed lineage-specific patterns of acylation."
