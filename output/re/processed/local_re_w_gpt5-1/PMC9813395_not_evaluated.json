Actin-related proteins (ARPs) also play central roles in plant growth, including cell elongation and development. However, the relationships between ARPs and GA signaling and biosynthesis are not fully understood. Here, we isolated OsGASD, encoding an ARP subunit from rice (Oryza sativa), using the Ac/Ds knockout system. The osgasd knockout (Ko) mutation reduced GA3 content in shoots as well as plant growth and height. However, GA application restored the plant height of the osgasd Ko mutant to a height similar to that of the wild type (WT). Rice plants overexpressing OsGASD (Ox) showed increased plant height and grain yield compared to the WT. Transcriptome analysis of flag leaves of OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko plants revealed that OsGASD regulates cell development and the expression of elongation-related genes. These observations suggest that OsGASD is involved in maintaining GA homeostasis to regulate plant development, thereby affecting rice growth and productivity."

We therefore analyzed OsGASD expression in response to GA, finding that it increased in shoots (but not roots) in response to GA treatment ( Figure 2 ,  S2 ). In addition, plant height and the lengths of panicles and internodes in the osgasd Ko mutant were restored to WT levels in response to GA treatment ( Figures 2B-F ). Furthermore, the shoots of OsGASD Ox plants had higher GA3 contents than WT shoots, whereas the shoots of the osgasd Ko mutant had lower GA3 content than WT shoots. However, GA3 contents in the roots of both OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko plants were similar to those of WT plants ( Figures 3A, B ). These results suggest that OsGASD is involved in GA biosynthesis in rice shoots. In Arabidopsis, both AtCPS- and AtCPS/AtKS-overexpressing transgenic plants showed increased accumulation of ent-kaurene and ent-kaurenoic acid, two early intermediates in the GA biosynthetic pathway, but normal levels of bioactive GA. Here, we analyzed the expression of key genes involved in GA biosynthesis, such CPS, KS, KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2. Whereas KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2 were upregulated in the shoots of young OsGASD Ox plants, the expression of CPS and KS was not significantly altered ( Figure 3C ).

The plant height of 14-week-old osgasd Ko mutants increased with increasing GA3 concentration, with the height of the osgasd Ko plants treated with 10 ppm GA3 being restored to level similar to those of WT plants ( Figures 2C, D ). We also analyzed internode elongation, panicle length, and tiller number in the osgasd Ko mutant ( Figures 2E, F ).

			"context": "GAs are closely related to plant growth processes, such as seed and flower development, leaf expansion, and shoot elongation. We therefore analyzed OsGASD expression in response to GA, finding that it increased in shoots (but not roots) in response to GA treatment ( Figure 2 ,  S2 ). In addition, plant height and the lengths of panicles and internodes in the osgasd Ko mutant were restored to WT levels in response to GA treatment ( Figures 2B-F ). Furthermore, the shoots of OsGASD Ox plants had higher GA3 contents than WT shoots, whereas the shoots of the osgasd Ko mutant had lower GA3 content than WT shoots. However, GA3 contents in the roots of both OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko plants were similar to those of WT plants ( Figures 3A, B ). These results suggest that OsGASD is involved in GA biosynthesis in rice shoots. In Arabidopsis, both AtCPS- and AtCPS/AtKS-overexpressing transgenic plants showed increased accumulation of ent-kaurene and ent-kaurenoic acid, two early intermediates in the GA biosynthetic pathway, but normal levels of bioactive GA. Here, we analyzed the expression of key genes involved in GA biosynthesis, such CPS, KS, KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2. Whereas KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2 were upregulated in the shoots of young OsGASD Ox plants, the expression of CPS and KS was not significantly altered ( Figure 3C ). These results indicate that OsGASD mediates the accumulation of bioactive GA in young shoots during development.\nGibberellic acids (GAs) are plant hormones with a wide range of developmental activities, including plant elongation. GA-deficient plants were significantly shorter than the WT, but their height was restored to WT levels by applying GA3. Recent progress has been made in identifying genes involved in GA metabolism and signaling pathways. GA biosynthesis involves a series of pathways in which metabolic enzymes interact. Copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), a terpene cyclase, catalyzes the first specific step of the GA biosynthesis pathway to produce ent-kaurene oxidase. Morphology of CPS overexpressing-transgenic rice show similar to the WT, despite increased expression of the ent-kaurene gene. Within the GA biosynthesis pathway, dioxygenases are important for providing GA for various developmental processes, and the total biosynthesis of bioactive GA is ultimately controlled by the dioxygenases GA3ox and GA20ox. Different expression patterns of GA20ox contribute to phenotypic variation in Arabidopsis, with GA20ox overexpression increasing the production of bioactive GAs, which influence plant growth. In rice, meanwhile, functionally deficient mutants of GA20ox show a typical dwarf phenotype."

			"context": "GAs are closely related to plant growth processes, such as seed and flower development, leaf expansion, and shoot elongation. We therefore analyzed OsGASD expression in response to GA, finding that it increased in shoots (but not roots) in response to GA treatment ( Figure 2 ,  S2 ). In addition, plant height and the lengths of panicles and internodes in the osgasd Ko mutant were restored to WT levels in response to GA treatment ( Figures 2B-F ). Furthermore, the shoots of OsGASD Ox plants had higher GA3 contents than WT shoots, whereas the shoots of the osgasd Ko mutant had lower GA3 content than WT shoots. However, GA3 contents in the roots of both OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko plants were similar to those of WT plants ( Figures 3A, B ). These results suggest that OsGASD is involved in GA biosynthesis in rice shoots. In Arabidopsis, both AtCPS- and AtCPS/AtKS-overexpressing transgenic plants showed increased accumulation of ent-kaurene and ent-kaurenoic acid, two early intermediates in the GA biosynthetic pathway, but normal levels of bioactive GA. Here, we analyzed the expression of key genes involved in GA biosynthesis, such CPS, KS, KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2. Whereas KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2 were upregulated in the shoots of young OsGASD Ox plants, the expression of CPS and KS was not significantly altered ( Figure 3C ). These results indicate that OsGASD mediates the accumulation of bioactive GA in young shoots during development.\nTherefore, we expected that the osgasd Ko mutant lacking OsGASD activity would exhibit some morphological changes in response to GA. We analyzed the sensitivity of these mutants and WT to GA treatment ( Figure S3  and  Figures 2C-F ). In response to GA spray treatment, 5-weeks-old osgasd Ko mutants increase of plant height compared to the WT ( Figures S3A, B ). The plant height of 14-week-old osgasd Ko mutants increased with increasing GA3 concentration, with the height of the osgasd Ko plants treated with 10 ppm GA3 being restored to level similar to those of WT plants ( Figures 2C, D ). We also analyzed internode elongation, panicle length, and tiller number in the osgasd Ko mutant ( Figures 2E, F ). With increasing GA3 concentration, the lengths of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth internodes in the mutant increased, while the panicle length was not significantly altered, and the tiller number decreased. These results, together with the expression pattern of OsGASD and the GA sensitivity of the osgasd Ko mutant, suggest that OsGASD function is related to GA biosynthesis during plant growth."

The plant height of 14-week-old osgasd Ko mutants increased with increasing GA3 concentration, with the height of the osgasd Ko plants treated with 10 ppm GA3 being restored to level similar to those of WT plants ( Figures 2C, D ). We also analyzed internode elongation, panicle length, and tiller number in the osgasd Ko mutant ( Figures 2E, F ). With increasing GA3 concentration, the lengths of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth internodes in the mutant increased, while the panicle length was not significantly altered, and the tiller number decreased. These results, together with the expression pattern of OsGASD and the GA sensitivity of the osgasd Ko mutant, suggest that OsGASD function is related to GA biosynthesis during plant growth."

Actin-related proteins (ARPs) also play central roles in plant growth, including cell elongation and development. However, the relationships between ARPs and GA signaling and biosynthesis are not fully understood. Here, we isolated OsGASD, encoding an ARP subunit from rice (Oryza sativa), using the Ac/Ds knockout system. The osgasd knockout (Ko) mutation reduced GA3 content in shoots as well as plant growth and height. However, GA application restored the plant height of the osgasd Ko mutant to a height similar to that of the wild type (WT). Rice plants overexpressing OsGASD (Ox) showed increased plant height and grain yield compared to the WT. Transcriptome analysis of flag leaves of OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko plants revealed that OsGASD regulates cell development and the expression of elongation-related genes. These observations suggest that OsGASD is involved in maintaining GA homeostasis to regulate plant development, thereby affecting rice growth and productivity.\nIn this current study, we used the Ac/Ds knockout system to generate new loss-of-function rice mutants with growth defects. By analyzing these mutants, we identified a novel gene encoding the ARPC2 subunit, which we named gibberellic acid sensitive dwarf (GASD). To investigate the role of OsGASD in plant development, we performed phenotypic and transcriptomic analysis of OsGASD-overexpressing (Ox) and OsGASD knockout (Ko) plants. Based on our findings, we propose that OsGASD is involved in the GA biosynthetic pathway and plays important roles in regulating plant growth and productivity. Our findings also shed light on the interactions between ARP genes and GAs."

			"context": "To further explore these effects, we analyzed the transcriptomes of flag leaves from OsGASD Ox, osgasd Ko, and WT plants at the mature stage (25-week-old plants) by transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis. An analysis of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) indicated that 46 genes were upregulated in OsGASD Ox and downregulated in osgasd Ko compared to WT plants. Moreover, 122 genes were downregulated in OsGASD Ox and upregulated in osgasd Ko plants. To identify key genes, we examined the putative functions of the DEGs by Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, finding that they included a number of genes related to plant development. We selected genes with previously reported functions in rice or homologous genes reported in Arabidopsis ( Table S2 ). A previous study had indicated that plants overexpressing OsGH3-9, OsCCR5, and OsUFGT showed enhanced shoot growth and seed formation due to increased cell development and elongation. OsKS8-, OsTEM1-, and OsGrx-C7-overexpressing plants showed phenotypes similar to those of the osgasd Ko mutants, such as a dwarf stature and poor plant growth. To validated the expression patterns of these selected genes, we analyzed their expression patterns by RT-qPCR, obtaining results similar to the RNA-seq results ( Figures 5E, F ). OsCCR5, OsNCED3 and OsUFGT were upregulated in OsGASD Ox and downregulated in osgasd Ko. However, OsGH3-9 was upregulated in OsGASD Ox but was not downregulated in osgasd Ko ( Figure 5E ). OsKS8, OsTEM1 and OsGrx-C7 were downregulated in OsGASD Ox and upregulated in osgasd Ko ( Figure 5F ). These results indicate that OsGASD regulates the expression of plant development-related genes involved in flag leaf development and plant productivity, suggesting that it is helps control overall plant growth by regulating OsGASD-mediated GA biosynthesis."

Here, we analyzed the expression of key genes involved in GA biosynthesis, such CPS, KS, KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2. Whereas KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2 were upregulated in the shoots of young OsGASD Ox plants, the expression of CPS and KS was not significantly altered ( Figure 3C ). These results indicate that OsGASD mediates the accumulation of bioactive GA in young shoots during development."

We therefore analyzed OsGASD expression in response to GA, finding that it increased in shoots (but not roots) in response to GA treatment ( Figure 2 ,  S2 ). In addition, plant height and the lengths of panicles and internodes in the osgasd Ko mutant were restored to WT levels in response to GA treatment ( Figures 2B-F ). Furthermore, the shoots of OsGASD Ox plants had higher GA3 contents than WT shoots, whereas the shoots of the osgasd Ko mutant had lower GA3 content than WT shoots.

To investigate the role of OsGASD in plant development, we performed phenotypic and transcriptomic analysis of OsGASD-overexpressing (Ox) and OsGASD knockout (Ko) plants. Based on our findings, we propose that OsGASD is involved in the GA biosynthetic pathway and plays important roles in regulating plant growth and productivity.

			"context": "Gibberellic acids (GAs) are plant hormones with a wide range of developmental activities, including plant elongation. GA-deficient plants were significantly shorter than the WT, but their height was restored to WT levels by applying GA3. Recent progress has been made in identifying genes involved in GA metabolism and signaling pathways. GA biosynthesis involves a series of pathways in which metabolic enzymes interact. Copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), a terpene cyclase, catalyzes the first specific step of the GA biosynthesis pathway to produce ent-kaurene oxidase. Morphology of CPS overexpressing-transgenic rice show similar to the WT, despite increased expression of the ent-kaurene gene. Within the GA biosynthesis pathway, dioxygenases are important for providing GA for various developmental processes, and the total biosynthesis of bioactive GA is ultimately controlled by the dioxygenases GA3ox and GA20ox. Different expression patterns of GA20ox contribute to phenotypic variation in Arabidopsis, with GA20ox overexpression increasing the production of bioactive GAs, which influence plant growth. In rice, meanwhile, functionally deficient mutants of GA20ox show a typical dwarf phenotype."

			"context": "Gibberellic acids (GAs) are plant hormones with a wide range of developmental activities, including plant elongation. GA-deficient plants were significantly shorter than the WT, but their height was restored to WT levels by applying GA3. Recent progress has been made in identifying genes involved in GA metabolism and signaling pathways. GA biosynthesis involves a series of pathways in which metabolic enzymes interact. Copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), a terpene cyclase, catalyzes the first specific step of the GA biosynthesis pathway to produce ent-kaurene oxidase. Morphology of CPS overexpressing-transgenic rice show similar to the WT, despite increased expression of the ent-kaurene gene. Within the GA biosynthesis pathway, dioxygenases are important for providing GA for various developmental processes, and the total biosynthesis of bioactive GA is ultimately controlled by the dioxygenases GA3ox and GA20ox. Different expression patterns of GA20ox contribute to phenotypic variation in Arabidopsis, with GA20ox overexpression increasing the production of bioactive GAs, which influence plant growth. In rice, meanwhile, functionally deficient mutants of GA20ox show a typical dwarf phenotype."

OsGASD shared approximately 15-35% sequence identity with its homologs from Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana], cattle [Bos taurus], fruit fly [Drosophila melanogaster], nematode [Caenorhabditis elegans], and yeast [Saccharomyces cerevisiae]). AtARPC2B and OsARPC2B share C-terminal amino acids representing a conserved domain of ARPC2Bs. The subcellular localizations of ARPs are in the nucleus to perform their specific function. We investigated the subcellular localization of fluorescent protein-tagged OsGASD and DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) that is nuclear staining dye using a rice protoplast transient expression system ( Figure S2 ). OsGASD co-localized with DAPI. This indicates that OsGASD is nucleus localizing proteins. These results indicate that OsGASD encodes a ARPC2B protein that is involved in plant development."

We therefore analyzed OsGASD expression in response to GA, finding that it increased in shoots (but not roots) in response to GA treatment ( Figure 2 ,  S2 ). In addition, plant height and the lengths of panicles and internodes in the osgasd Ko mutant were restored to WT levels in response to GA treatment ( Figures 2B-F ). Furthermore, the shoots of OsGASD Ox plants had higher GA3 contents than WT shoots, whereas the shoots of the osgasd Ko mutant had lower GA3 content than WT shoots. However, GA3 contents in the roots of both OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko plants were similar to those of WT plants ( Figures 3A, B ). These results suggest that OsGASD is involved in GA biosynthesis in rice shoots. In Arabidopsis, both AtCPS- and AtCPS/AtKS-overexpressing transgenic plants showed increased accumulation of ent-kaurene and ent-kaurenoic acid, two early intermediates in the GA biosynthetic pathway, but normal levels of bioactive GA. Here, we analyzed the expression of key genes involved in GA biosynthesis, such CPS, KS, KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2. Whereas KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2 were upregulated in the shoots of young OsGASD Ox plants, the expression of CPS and KS was not significantly altered ( Figure 3C ). These results indicate that OsGASD mediates the accumulation of bioactive GA in young shoots during development."
