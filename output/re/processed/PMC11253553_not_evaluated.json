			"context": "In our study, high temperature suppressed the herbivory-induced accumulation of jasmonates, primary and specialized metabolites in potato plants. The decrease in soluble sugar level and transcript accumulation is possibly attributed to a reduction in photosynthesis parameters due to stomata closure under elevated temperature. Also, our previous research show that the emission of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in potato (cv. Lishu 6) leaves were enhanced by high temperature treatment, which subsequently affected the plants' attractiveness to the P. operculella and its egg parasitoid wasp. This distinction might be due to the use of different cultivars, whilst it is also possible that plants may differentially regulate the production of volatile and nonvolatile secondary compounds under elevated temperature. While the alteration of levels of herbivory-induced secondary metabolites (i.e.: polyphenol oxidase and glucosinolates) by high temperature have been found in many plants including tomato and watermelon, evidence for the suppression of herbivory-induced primary metabolism by high temperature remains scarce. We propose that this suppression is related to the JA-signaling in potato plants, since the herbivory-induced JA biosynthetic genes and JA accumulations were suppressed by high temperature. However, whether suppressing JA-signaling could benefit the plant response to high temperature remains to be clarified in future."

For instance, the concentration of many specialized metabolites, including flavonoids, phenolics, and terpenoids, are altered in plants grown under high temperatures, which subsequently affects the performance of herbivores on plants. This is partially attributed to high temperature-driven modification of the activity of plant enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of these metabolites. Apart from endogenous metabolites, the emission of volatile organic compounds is also modulated by temperature. In potato, a cool-weather crop, for instance, high temperature enhances the emission of one key volatile organic compound (ss-caryophyllene) from herbivory-induced leaves, which reduces the attractiveness of this plant to P. operculella adult moths but enhances its recruitment to the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma chilonis of this pest, indicating that temperature can affect potato's induced defenses against these insects."

In HT conditions, while the transcripts of them were suppressed, some copies of these genes (CS, ACO, IDH, OGDC, DLD, DLST, SDS, SDH, MDH) were still transiently induced at 1 h post herbivory. In a similar manner, temperature also modulated the concentration of soluble sugars. More specifically, the concentration of soluble sugars (fructose, glucose, galactose, inositol, mannitol, sorbitol, sucrose) was increased upon herbivory in plants under CT, specially 5 h after simulated herbivory (Fig. 5B-H). The opposite pattern was observed in plants under HT as most of the sugars were reduced 5 h after simulated herbivory (Fig. 5B-H). Together, temperature modulates changes in primary metabolism upon simulated herbivory attack."

In CT plants, the transcripts of most of the genes of the mevalonate (HMGR, FPPS, SQS, CAS, SSR2), the SGAs biosynthesis (GAME, SGT1, SGT2), and the TPI biosynthesis (TPI) pathways were up-regulated by herbivory. In contrast, the induction of these genes was weaker in HT plants (Fig. 6A and B). Accordingly, we observed that the induction of alpha-solanine and TPI activity was weaker in HT plants compared to CT plants (Fig. 6C and E). The content of alpha-chaconine was not influenced by herbivory or temperature (Fig. 6D). Hence, temperature influences the accumulation of herbivory-induced specialized metabolites in potato plants, possibly by regulating their biosynthesis."

Among them, jasmonates are master regulators of several herbivory-induced defense responses. We observed that JA, JA-biosynthesis and JA-signaling genes, are strongly induced upon herbivory in potato plants. Alterations in herbivory-induced JA were usually accompanied by changed accumulation of primary and specialized metabolites in many plants. In our study, the primary (soluble sugars) and secondary (SGAs, TPI) metabolites, together with their biosynthetic genes, are strongly induced upon herbivory. Meanwhile, levels of these metabolites and their related biosynthetic genes were strongly activated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment (Fig. S5 and S6), indicating that JA-signaling also plays an important role in potato's induced defense against the P. operculella (Fig. 8). Indeed, suppressing herbivory-induced JA accumulation in JA-reduced plants significantly weakened their defense against P. operculella, whereas enhancing herbivory-induced JA-Ile accumulation in JA-Ile-elevated plants and applying MeJA both strengthened their defense against P. operculella. We demonstrated that JA signaling plays an important role in plants' defense against P. operculella. Previous studies indicated that JA signaling is also related with HT. However, the co-stress-induced pattern by herbivory and high temperature remained unclear."

			"context": "In summary, our study shows that transient exposure to high temperature decreases JA signaling mediated plant-induced resistance to herbivore attack by reprogramming plant transcripts and metabolome (Fig. 8). According to previous studies in other plant-insect interacting systems, positive effects of elevated ambient temperature on plants' herbivore defense were also observed. Potato is a cool-weather crop whose physiology is strongly affected by high temperature. It is likely that a 'resource reallocation' happened in potato plants when high temperature and herbivory stresses coexisted. In plants that are more adapted to eco-niche with warmer temperature, a different pattern may occur for their defense signaling activation, resource allocation and defensive secondary compounds production up on herbivory."
