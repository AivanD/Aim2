(a) A representative leaf is shown from the agroinfiltration of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes from Stegnosperma halimifolium, Beta vulgaris, Carnegiea gigantea and Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs containing the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The infiltration spots are labelled according to the DODA variant. For all species, the pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector is included as a positive control (P). (b) The betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC and data were represented relative to the BvDODAalpha1 spot present in each biological replicate. The data were combined after calculating relative amounts (RQ) for each species from individual species-specific experiments (Supporting Information Figs S8-S11). Bars show means +- SD; n = 5 for S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, C. gigantea and M. crystallinum, except for BvDODAalpha2 (n = 4) and BvDODAalpha3 (n = 4). (c) A representative HPLC trace for the DODA\nalpha\n1 gene from each species. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples."

			"justification": "evidence of DODA alpha loci with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity within anthocyanic M. australis, K. caespitosa, C. ramosissimum and T. imperati.",
			"context": "Yet, we earlier reported that DODA alpha are lost or down-regulated in anthocyanic Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae, and previously argued that loss of DODA alpha in these anthocyanic lineages is consistent with reversals from betalain pigmentation to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015).\nHowever, the emerging picture is more complex, and with new data presented here, we find: evidence of DODA alpha loci in all but one of the anthocyanic lineages in Caryophyllales; evidence of DODA alpha gene loss in Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae, but no evidence of DODA alpha gene loss in the anthocyanin-pigmented lineages, K. caespitosa, M. australis and L. aethiopicum; and evidence of DODA alpha loci with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity within anthocyanic M. australis, K. caespitosa, C. ramosissimum and T. imperati.\nClearly, evolutionarily disparate anthocyanic lineages show different patterns of molecular evolution with respect to DODA alpha.\nGiven this complex evolutionary milieu, and in the face of compelling evidence for polyphyletic origins of elevated l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, below we propose two alternative hypotheses to explain loss of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages.\nThe patterns we detect may suggest lability in early stages of betalain evolution.\nThe patterns we detect may suggest lability in early stages of betalain evolution. Anthocyanins and betalains have never been found to co-occur, but it is possible that the two classes of pigments did co-occur in early evolutionary stages. In this scenario, repeated evolution of increased l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity allowed for betalain pigmentation, initially co-occurring with anthocyanins. However, evolution of an integrated betalain pathway requires more than biosynthetic enzymes (e.g. the recruitment of the MYB transcriptional regulators; Hatlestad et al., 2014). Therefore, establishment and enhancement of the betalain pathway was only achieved in certain lineages, those which specialised to betalain pigmentation. By contrast, other lineages arising close to the origins of elevated l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity specialised to anthocyanins rather than betalains, ultimately losing the DODAalpha paralogues with elevated l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. In these cases, anthocyanic lineages may have retained anthocyanins from ancestors in which both pigments coexisted, and inferences of reversals to anthocyanins based on DODA alpha loss are misleading. This scenario is appealing because we do not see any anthocyanin lineages that are nested deeply within the betalain-pigmented clades that stem from each inferred origin (Fig. 2), and so shifts to anthocyanin pigmentation seem less likely with evolutionary distance from inferred origins of betalain pigmentation."

The core genes encoding betalain synthesis enzymes have been elucidated, primarily through heterologous assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana, which has emerged as an essential tool for betalain research in planta (Polturak et al., 2016; Timoneda et al., 2018). The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments. l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family (Christinet et al., 2004). Within Caryophyllales, a gene duplication in the LigB/DODA gene lineage gave rise to the DODAalpha and DODAbeta clades, with l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity previously inferred to have evolved at the base of the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). On the basis of this Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, and subsequent losses of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages, we previously argued for a single origin of betalain pigmentation, with multiple reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015)."

			"context": "In contrast to the anthocyanin pathway, the betalain biosynthetic pathway is relatively simple, involving as few as four enzymatic steps to proceed from tyrosine to stable betalain pigments: yellow betaxanthins and violet betacyanins (Fig. 1). The core genes encoding betalain synthesis enzymes have been elucidated, primarily through heterologous assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana, which has emerged as an essential tool for betalain research in planta (Polturak et al., 2016; Timoneda et al., 2018). The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments. l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family (Christinet et al., 2004). Within Caryophyllales, a gene duplication in the LigB/DODA gene lineage gave rise to the DODAalpha and DODAbeta clades, with l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity previously inferred to have evolved at the base of the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). On the basis of this Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, and subsequent losses of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages, we previously argued for a single origin of betalain pigmentation, with multiple reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015)."

(b) The betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC and data were represented relative to the BvDODAalpha1 spot present in each biological replicate. The data were combined after calculating relative amounts (RQ) for each species from individual species-specific experiments (Supporting Information Figs S8-S11). Bars show means +- SD; n = 5 for S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, C. gigantea and M. crystallinum, except for BvDODAalpha2 (n = 4) and BvDODAalpha3 (n = 4). (c) A representative HPLC trace for the DODA\nalpha\n1 gene from each species. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples."

The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs with the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector was included as a positive control (P). (b) Betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC. Amounts of betanin were calculated relative (RQ) to the average amount of betanin present in BvDODAalpha1 infiltration spots for each species and the data combined into one graph (see Supporting Information Fig. S12 for species-specific data).
