Four distinct trichomatic nectaries develop in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), one floral and three extrafloral, and the nectars they secrete serve different purposes. Floral nectar attracts bees for promoting pollination, while extrafloral nectar attracts predatory insects as a means of indirect protection from herbivores. Cotton therefore provides an ideal system for contrasting mechanisms of nectar production and nectar composition between different nectary types. Here, we report the transcriptome and ultrastructure of the four cotton nectary types throughout development and compare these with the metabolomes of secreted nectars. Integration of these datasets supports specialization among nectary types to fulfill their ecological niche, while conserving parallel coordination of the merocrine-based and eccrine-based models of nectar biosynthesis. Nectary ultrastructures indicate an abundance of rough endoplasmic reticulum positioned parallel to the cell walls and a profusion of vesicles fusing to the plasma membranes, supporting the merocrine model of nectar biosynthesis. The eccrine-based model of nectar biosynthesis is supported by global transcriptomics data, which indicate a progression from starch biosynthesis to starch degradation and sucrose biosynthesis and secretion. Moreover, our nectary global transcriptomics data provide evidence for novel metabolic processes supporting de novo biosynthesis of amino acids secreted in trace quantities in nectars. Collectively, these data demonstrate the conservation of nectar-producing models among trichomatic and extrafloral nectaries."

			"context": "Our metabolic profiling of the cotton nectars extensively details the variation between the floral and extrafloral nectar compositions. The distinct nectars produced by cotton floral and extrafloral nectaries parallel the feeding preferences of the mutualists that visit these nectaries. The floral nectary is primarily visited by honey bee pollinators, while the extrafloral nectaries are visited by protective predatory ants. Specifically, reflecting that bees prefer to feed on hexose-rich nectar, the floral nectar is the most hexose rich of the nectars that are produced by the four nectary types, containing minimal amounts of sucrose. Similarly, multiple positive attributes have been associated between dietary amino acids and bee health, which include (1) the phagostimulatory effect of phenylalanine and GABA; (2) conferring health benefits by GABA-enriched artificial nectar; (3) flavor stimulatory effects of leucine and tryptophan on sugar chemosensory cells; and (4) access to a rapid energy source for initial flight take-off provided by proline. Consistent with these feeding preference attributes of bees, the highest abundance and widest variety of amino acids were found in the cotton floral nectar, which uniquely contained GABA, a non-proteinaceous amino acid."

As would be expected for secretory organs, the expression of these transporter-coding genes generally peak during the secretory stage of nectary development (27% of foliar, 39% of floral, 81% of bracteal, and 86% of circumbracteal; Supplemental Figure S6). The 79 transporters identified are predicted to transport sugars, amino acids, water, and various ions (borate, phosphate, hydrogen, calcium, chloride, iron, potassium, and zinc; Supplemental Dataset S9). Transporters that commonly show peak expression at either the pre-secretory or secretory stage of all four nectary types include those needed for the movement of water via plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (AT2G37170, AT3G53420, AT2G45960 homologs). In contrast, the amino acid transporters, PROT1 (AT2G39890), AT1G47670, and AT3G56200 homologs, show differential expression during the development of floral, bracteal, and circumbracteal nectaries, but not in the foliar nectary (Supplemental Dataset S9 and Supplemental Figure S6)."

The heat map presented in Figure 9 illustrates the temporal expression patterns of the 20 selected genes among the four different nectary types as they each undergo development (Supplemental Dataset S10).

Similarly, however, the expression of genes encoding transporters of the minor components of the nectars would indicate that the eccrine model applies equally to these classes of metabolites. In support of this hypothesis, the transcriptomes of developing cotton nectaries reveal upregulated expression of plasma membrane-H+-ATPase, sugar:proton symporters, amino acid transporters, and lipid transmembrane transporters at the secretory stage of nectary development. The expression of such ATPase transmembrane transporters and proton gradients has previously been suggested to facilitate export of nectar metabolites. Moreover, the occurrence of calcium oxalate crystals (druses) around the vasculature and throughout the nectary parenchyma tissues may indicate the need to regulate calcium levels by sequestration as insoluble salts to negate the inhibitory effects of this cation on plasma membrane ATPases."

In contrast, the other three cotton nectaries produce nectars that are more sucrose enriched, and CWINV4 expression is almost one-sixth the level of SWEET9 expression (Figure 7 and Supplemental Dataset S2).

The distinct nectars produced by cotton floral and extrafloral nectaries parallel the feeding preferences of the mutualists that visit these nectaries.

			"context": "Domesticated Upland cotton, Gossypium hirsutum, develops a floral and three extrafloral nectaries, which are further subcategorized as vegetative or reproductive. All nectaries are trichomatic and secrete nectar from specialized papillae, a type of multicellular glandular trichome. The secreted nectars are sugar-rich solutions presented as a reward to attract animal mutualists in exchange for ecosystem services. The timing of nectar secretion varies among the different cotton nectaries, and is optimized for planta benefits, while minimizing the energetic cost of producing the nectar. Although cotton is largely a self-pollinating crop, honey bee visitations are facilitated by the floral nectar reward and increases boll and lint mass yield. However, the extrafloral nectars provide a source of indirect protection by attracting aggressive predatory ants, which ward off herbivores. Consequently, the extrafloral nectaries modulate nectar secretion based on the environmental stress of insect herbivory. Overall, these plant-animal mutualisms improve plant fitness and reproductive success."

			"context": "The most prevalent models of nectar synthesis and secretion are the merocrine- and eccrine-based models summarized in Figure 1. The merocrine model is based primarily on ultrastructural analyses, which suggest that nectar metabolites are packed into vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum or Golgi-derived vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane for secretion. Studies using \"omics\" technologies on the floral nectaries of Arabidopsis, Cucurbita pepo, and Nicotiana spp. have provided evidence that support an eccrine-based model. In this model, pores and transporters are used to move \"pre-nectar\" sugar metabolites through the plasma membrane of nectariferous parenchyma tissues (reviewed by), and these sugars are transiently stored as starch in the nectary parenchyma. At the time of nectar secretion, the stored starch is rapidly hydrolyzed and converted to sucrose and exported. Subsequent hydrolysis of sucrose by a cell wall invertase can generate glucose and fructose, thereby maintaining the sucrose concentration gradient needed for passive secretion. The last step of sucrose hydrolysis is also critical to the production of hexose-rich nectars, but this plays a minimal role in the production of sucrose-rich nectars.\nComparative summary of the eccrine- and merocrine-based models of nectar synthesis and secretion. In the eccrine-based model, starch accumulates in the nectary tissue (1) and is subsequently degraded (2) to provide precursors for the biosynthesis of sucrose (3). Export of sucrose through the plasma membrane into the apoplasm (4) is facilitated by transmembrane transporters, such as the uniporter SWEET9 or possibly by H+-sucrose antiporters. Finally, sucrose in the apoplasm is hydrolyzed (5) by CELL WALL INVERTASE4. In the merocrine-based model, processes 1-3 are synonymous to the eccrine-based model. Sucrose and other nectar metabolites are packaged into endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and/or Golgi-derived vesicle (4), which fuse with the plasma membrane (5) to release the vesicle content into the apoplasm."

			"context": "Following passage through the cell wall, nectar initially accumulates in the subcuticular space between the cell wall and cuticle, as evident by the separation of the cuticle from the cell wall at the papillae head cells in all four cotton nectary types. In parallel, microchannels or fractures develop in the cuticle, potentially due to hydrostatic pressure, which would facilitate the release of nectar from the nectary. These actions may require the deposition of new cuticular lipids, which may be the driver for the observed upregulated expression of cuticle deposition genes. This phenomenon of cuticle separation and fracturing commonly occurs in the trichomatic nectaries of a variety of other species, included within Malvaceae, and these cuticular channels would thus function as valves, releasing discrete droplets of nectar once hydrostatic pressure exceeds a threshold."

Similarly, however, the expression of genes encoding transporters of the minor components of the nectars would indicate that the eccrine model applies equally to these classes of metabolites. In support of this hypothesis, the transcriptomes of developing cotton nectaries reveal upregulated expression of plasma membrane-H+-ATPase, sugar:proton symporters, amino acid transporters, and lipid transmembrane transporters at the secretory stage of nectary development. The expression of such ATPase transmembrane transporters and proton gradients has previously been suggested to facilitate export of nectar metabolites. Moreover, the occurrence of calcium oxalate crystals (druses) around the vasculature and throughout the nectary parenchyma tissues may indicate the need to regulate calcium levels by sequestration as insoluble salts to negate the inhibitory effects of this cation on plasma membrane ATPases."

The floral nectary is primarily visited by honey bee pollinators, while the extrafloral nectaries are visited by protective predatory ants. Specifically, reflecting that bees prefer to feed on hexose-rich nectar, the floral nectar is the most hexose rich of the nectars that are produced by the four nectary types, containing minimal amounts of sucrose. Similarly, multiple positive attributes have been associated between dietary amino acids and bee health, which include (1) the phagostimulatory effect of phenylalanine and GABA; (2) conferring health benefits by GABA-enriched artificial nectar; (3) flavor stimulatory effects of leucine and tryptophan on sugar chemosensory cells; and (4) access to a rapid energy source for initial flight take-off provided by proline. Consistent with these feeding preference attributes of bees, the highest abundance and widest variety of amino acids were found in the cotton floral nectar, which uniquely contained GABA, a non-proteinaceous amino acid."

These compositional variations are visualized by the pairwise volcano plots shown in Figure 3, which reveal that 105 of the 197 detected analytes significantly differ in abundance in at least one pairwise comparison (q-value < 0.05, Supplemental File S1). The floral nectar is compositionally most distinct from the extrafloral nectars, with at least 68 distinguishing analytes between the former and each of the extrafloral nectars (Figure 3, A-C). Specifically, the amino acids are more abundant in the floral nectar (Table 1 and Supplemental Figure S2, Cluster 8), particularly aspartic acid, asparagine, leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which occur exclusively in the floral nectar (Supplemental Figure S1 and Supplemental Dataset S1). Another distinguishing compositional difference among the amino acids profiles is the high proportion of non-proteinaceous amino acids present in the extrafloral nectars, largely composed of beta-alanine (i.e., 6%-20% in extrafloral nectar, compared with 0.05% of floral nectar; Table 1 and Supplemental Figure S3)."

These compositional variations are visualized by the pairwise volcano plots shown in Figure 3, which reveal that 105 of the 197 detected analytes significantly differ in abundance in at least one pairwise comparison (q-value < 0.05, Supplemental File S1). The floral nectar is compositionally most distinct from the extrafloral nectars, with at least 68 distinguishing analytes between the former and each of the extrafloral nectars (Figure 3, A-C). Specifically, the amino acids are more abundant in the floral nectar (Table 1 and Supplemental Figure S2, Cluster 8), particularly aspartic acid, asparagine, leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which occur exclusively in the floral nectar (Supplemental Figure S1 and Supplemental Dataset S1). Another distinguishing compositional difference among the amino acids profiles is the high proportion of non-proteinaceous amino acids present in the extrafloral nectars, largely composed of beta-alanine (i.e., 6%-20% in extrafloral nectar, compared with 0.05% of floral nectar; Table 1 and Supplemental Figure S3).\nOur metabolic profiling of the cotton nectars extensively details the variation between the floral and extrafloral nectar compositions. The distinct nectars produced by cotton floral and extrafloral nectaries parallel the feeding preferences of the mutualists that visit these nectaries. The floral nectary is primarily visited by honey bee pollinators, while the extrafloral nectaries are visited by protective predatory ants. Specifically, reflecting that bees prefer to feed on hexose-rich nectar, the floral nectar is the most hexose rich of the nectars that are produced by the four nectary types, containing minimal amounts of sucrose. Similarly, multiple positive attributes have been associated between dietary amino acids and bee health, which include (1) the phagostimulatory effect of phenylalanine and GABA; (2) conferring health benefits by GABA-enriched artificial nectar; (3) flavor stimulatory effects of leucine and tryptophan on sugar chemosensory cells; and (4) access to a rapid energy source for initial flight take-off provided by proline. Consistent with these feeding preference attributes of bees, the highest abundance and widest variety of amino acids were found in the cotton floral nectar, which uniquely contained GABA, a non-proteinaceous amino acid."

			"context": "Moreover, the four different nectar types can also be distinguished based on the minor nectar metabolites, particularly upon comparing floral and the extrafloral nectars (Supplemental Figures S1, S2). These compositional variations are visualized by the pairwise volcano plots shown in Figure 3, which reveal that 105 of the 197 detected analytes significantly differ in abundance in at least one pairwise comparison (q-value < 0.05, Supplemental File S1). The floral nectar is compositionally most distinct from the extrafloral nectars, with at least 68 distinguishing analytes between the former and each of the extrafloral nectars (Figure 3, A-C). Specifically, the amino acids are more abundant in the floral nectar (Table 1 and Supplemental Figure S2, Cluster 8), particularly aspartic acid, asparagine, leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which occur exclusively in the floral nectar (Supplemental Figure S1 and Supplemental Dataset S1). Another distinguishing compositional difference among the amino acids profiles is the high proportion of non-proteinaceous amino acids present in the extrafloral nectars, largely composed of beta-alanine (i.e., 6%-20% in extrafloral nectar, compared with 0.05% of floral nectar; Table 1 and Supplemental Figure S3).\nOur metabolic profiling of the cotton nectars extensively details the variation between the floral and extrafloral nectar compositions.

			"context": "Our metabolic profiling of the cotton nectars extensively details the variation between the floral and extrafloral nectar compositions. The distinct nectars produced by cotton floral and extrafloral nectaries parallel the feeding preferences of the mutualists that visit these nectaries. The floral nectary is primarily visited by honey bee pollinators, while the extrafloral nectaries are visited by protective predatory ants. Specifically, reflecting that bees prefer to feed on hexose-rich nectar, the floral nectar is the most hexose rich of the nectars that are produced by the four nectary types, containing minimal amounts of sucrose. Similarly, multiple positive attributes have been associated between dietary amino acids and bee health, which include (1) the phagostimulatory effect of phenylalanine and GABA; (2) conferring health benefits by GABA-enriched artificial nectar; (3) flavor stimulatory effects of leucine and tryptophan on sugar chemosensory cells; and (4) access to a rapid energy source for initial flight take-off provided by proline. Consistent with these feeding preference attributes of bees, the highest abundance and widest variety of amino acids were found in the cotton floral nectar, which uniquely contained GABA, a non-proteinaceous amino acid."

An example of one of these glutamate utilizing enzymes is aspartate aminotransferase 3 (ASP3, AT5G11520), which displayed the highest expression among all nectaries at the pre-secretory and secretory stages (Figure 11, B). This enzyme utilizes glutamate and oxaloacetate to produce aspartic acid, one of the most abundant amino acids of floral and extrafloral nectars. Other such correlations between nectar amino acids and biosynthetic enzymes include phenylalanine and the biosynthetic enzyme, arogenate dehydratase 2 (ADT2, AT3G07630; Figure 11, F), and proline and the proline transporter PROT1 (AT2G39890, Supplemental Dataset S9 and Supplemental Figure S6)."

We identified that the nectary transcriptomes show high expression of a set of genes that use glutamate as a substrate for the biosynthesis of other amino acids (Figure 11, A, B, D, and E). Specifically, these gene products are primarily involved in the biosynthesis of alanine, aspartate, glycine, and branched chain amino acids, and they show peak expression during the secretory stage of the floral, bracteal, and circumbracteal nectaries. An example of one of these glutamate utilizing enzymes is aspartate aminotransferase 3 (ASP3, AT5G11520), which displayed the highest expression among all nectaries at the pre-secretory and secretory stages (Figure 11, B). This enzyme utilizes glutamate and oxaloacetate to produce aspartic acid, one of the most abundant amino acids of floral and extrafloral nectars. Other such correlations between nectar amino acids and biosynthetic enzymes include phenylalanine and the biosynthetic enzyme, arogenate dehydratase 2 (ADT2, AT3G07630; Figure 11, F), and proline and the proline transporter PROT1 (AT2G39890, Supplemental Dataset S9 and Supplemental Figure S6)."

Similarly, however, the expression of genes encoding transporters of the minor components of the nectars would indicate that the eccrine model applies equally to these classes of metabolites. In support of this hypothesis, the transcriptomes of developing cotton nectaries reveal upregulated expression of plasma membrane-H+-ATPase, sugar:proton symporters, amino acid transporters, and lipid transmembrane transporters at the secretory stage of nectary development. The expression of such ATPase transmembrane transporters and proton gradients has previously been suggested to facilitate export of nectar metabolites. Moreover, the occurrence of calcium oxalate crystals (druses) around the vasculature and throughout the nectary parenchyma tissues may indicate the need to regulate calcium levels by sequestration as insoluble salts to negate the inhibitory effects of this cation on plasma membrane ATPases."

The distinct nectars produced by cotton floral and extrafloral nectaries parallel the feeding preferences of the mutualists that visit these nectaries. The floral nectary is primarily visited by honey bee pollinators, while the extrafloral nectaries are visited by protective predatory ants. Specifically, reflecting that bees prefer to feed on hexose-rich nectar, the floral nectar is the most hexose rich of the nectars that are produced by the four nectary types, containing minimal amounts of sucrose. Similarly, multiple positive attributes have been associated between dietary amino acids and bee health, which include (1) the phagostimulatory effect of phenylalanine and GABA; (2) conferring health benefits by GABA-enriched artificial nectar; (3) flavor stimulatory effects of leucine and tryptophan on sugar chemosensory cells; and (4) access to a rapid energy source for initial flight take-off provided by proline. Consistent with these feeding preference attributes of bees, the highest abundance and widest variety of amino acids were found in the cotton floral nectar, which uniquely contained GABA, a non-proteinaceous amino acid."

We identified that the nectary transcriptomes show high expression of a set of genes that use glutamate as a substrate for the biosynthesis of other amino acids (Figure 11, A, B, D, and E). Specifically, these gene products are primarily involved in the biosynthesis of alanine, aspartate, glycine, and branched chain amino acids, and they show peak expression during the secretory stage of the floral, bracteal, and circumbracteal nectaries. An example of one of these glutamate utilizing enzymes is aspartate aminotransferase 3 (ASP3, AT5G11520), which displayed the highest expression among all nectaries at the pre-secretory and secretory stages (Figure 11, B). This enzyme utilizes glutamate and oxaloacetate to produce aspartic acid, one of the most abundant amino acids of floral and extrafloral nectars. Other such correlations between nectar amino acids and biosynthetic enzymes include phenylalanine and the biosynthetic enzyme, arogenate dehydratase 2 (ADT2, AT3G07630; Figure 11, F), and proline and the proline transporter PROT1 (AT2G39890, Supplemental Dataset S9 and Supplemental Figure S6)."

Specifically, in these nectaries eight genes related to cell wall re-structuring are significantly upregulated during the secretory stage; these include an expansin (EXLA1, AT3G45970), and genes required for the synthesis of cell wall components such as callose (GSL10, AT3G07160), hemicellulose (GALT6, AT5G62620), and pectins (PME17, AT2G45220). Likewise, 17 genes related to cuticular lipid metabolism, including fatty acyl elongation, transport of lipids, including the transport of cutin precursors (ABCG11, AT1G17840) are commonly upregulated in these two nectary-types."
