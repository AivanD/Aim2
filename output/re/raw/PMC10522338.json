The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato. The biosynthesis pathways leading to the production of these major SGAs from cultivated potato and tomato have largely been elucidated in recent years and it was found that the underlying genes occur in conserved clusters. This knowledge and the similarities between SGAs from S. commersonii and cultivated potato/tomato will help to identify the missing genes from the pathway through comparative genomics."

Wildtype CGN18024_3 is susceptible to the CPB genotype that was tested, but CGN18024_1 and CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1 or ScGTR2 are resistant, as illustrated by a very low larvae weight and survival (Figure 4c).

Plants from the nightshade family (Solanaceae) produce saponins that are characterised by a steroidal alkaloid aglycone, linked to a variable oligosaccharide chain (steroidal glycoalkaloids - SGAs). The protective effect of SGAs stems from their ability to interact with membrane sterols, disrupting the cell integrity from target organisms. In addition, they can act on the nervous system of pests and herbivores through their inhibitory effect on cholinesterase enzymes. As a consequence, SGAs can have both antimicrobial and anti-insect activity."

Using a bulked segregant RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq) approach, we mapped the resistance locus to the top of chromosome 12 of potato. We sequenced the genome of the resistant parent of the population and identified two glycosyltransferases (GTs) that can provide resistance to susceptible S. commersonii. We show that the resistance is based on the production of tetraose SGAs and provide in vitro evidence to show that they can be effective against other fungi besides A. solani. As SGAs can be involved in resistance against insects, we also tested if they can protect against Colorado potato beetle (CPB). Combined, our results show that the tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii have potential to provide resistance against a range of potato pathogens and pests."

Tomato and oat pathogens produce enzymes that can detoxify these compounds through removal of one or more glycosyl groups. The degradation products of saponins can also suppress plant defence responses. Conversely, here we show that the resistance of S. commersonii is based on the addition of a glycosyl group to a triose saponin from S. commersonii. There is large variation in both the aglycone and the sugar moiety of SGAs from wild Solanum, with likely over 100 distinct SGAs produced in tubers. This diversity suggests a pressure to evolve novel molecules, possibly to resist detoxification or other tolerance mechanisms, reminiscent of the molecular arms race that drives the evolution of plant immune receptors. Thus, wild Solanum germplasm is not only a rich source of immune receptors, it also provides a promising source of natural defence molecules. Studies of how pathogens that naturally occur on S. commersonii, or other Solanum species producing tetraose SGAs, can tolerate SGAs produced by their hosts could help judge the durability of this type of resistance."

Similar compounds are produced in Solanum species such as S. chacoense, S. chomatophilum, S. oplocense, S. paucisectum, and S. piurae, which may explain why these (or their descendants) display resistance to A. solani or CPB. The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato. The biosynthesis pathways leading to the production of these major SGAs from cultivated potato and tomato have largely been elucidated in recent years and it was found that the underlying genes occur in conserved clusters. This knowledge and the similarities between SGAs from S. commersonii and cultivated potato/tomato will help to identify the missing genes from the pathway through comparative genomics."

'Atlantic' and wildtype (WT) CGN18024_3 contain only triose SGAs. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3, resulting in a commertetraose (Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose, resulting in a lycotetraose (Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). Each boxplot displays the data of three seperate measurements (b) WT CGN18024_1/CGN18024_3 and CGN18024_3 transformants were inoculated with Alternaria solani altNL03003. Three plants of each genotype were tested and three leaves per plants were inoculated with six 10 microl droplets with spore suspension each. Lesions diameters were measured 5 days post inoculation. Significant differences with WT CGN18024_3 are indicated with asterisks (Welch's two-sample t-test, ***p < 0.001). ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 can both complement resistance to A. solani in CGN18024_3, as the lesion sizes produced on CGN18024_3 transformants are comparable to resistant CGN18024_1. (c) Three plants per genotype were challenged with five Colorado potato beetle larvae each. The tetraose SGAs produced by ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 can provide resistance to Colorado potato beetle, as indicated by reduced larvae survival and total larvae weight. Significant differences with WT CGN18024_3 are indicated with asterisks (Welch's two-sample t-test, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001). (d) Putative structures of SGAs detected in CGN18024_1 and CGN18024_3, based on previous studies. CGN18024_3 produces triose SGAs and is susceptible to Colorado potato beetle and A. solani. ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 from CGN18024_1 convert these triose SGAs from susceptible S. commersonii to tetraose SGAs, through the addition of a glucose or xylose moiety, respectively. Both sugar additions can provide resistance to Colorado potato beetle and A. solani."

			"context": "To investigate a possible role for ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in the production of tetraose SGAs from CGN18024_1 and their link to resistance, we generated stable transformants of ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in triose SGA producing CGN18024_3 (Figure 4:figure supplement 1). UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4)."

We sequenced the genome of the resistant parent of the population and identified two glycosyltransferases (GTs) that can provide resistance to susceptible S. commersonii. We show that the resistance is based on the production of tetraose SGAs and provide in vitro evidence to show that they can be effective against other fungi besides A. solani. As SGAs can be involved in resistance against insects, we also tested if they can protect against Colorado potato beetle (CPB). Combined, our results show that the tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii have potential to provide resistance against a range of potato pathogens and pests."

Similar compounds are produced in Solanum species such as S. chacoense, S. chomatophilum, S. oplocense, S. paucisectum, and S. piurae, which may explain why these (or their descendants) display resistance to A. solani or CPB. The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato. The biosynthesis pathways leading to the production of these major SGAs from cultivated potato and tomato have largely been elucidated in recent years and it was found that the underlying genes occur in conserved clusters.

			"context": "Solanum leaves usually contain SGAs, which are known phytoanticipins against fungi and other plant parasites. S. tuberosum typically produces the triose SGAs alpha-solanine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Rha) and alpha-chaconine (solanidine-Glu-Rha-Rha), while five major tetraose SGAs were previously identified in S. commersonii: commersonine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), dehydrocommersonine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), demissine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), dehydrodemissine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), and alpha-tomatine (tomatidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). To test if SGAs can explain resistance of S. commersonii, we measured SGA content in leaves from Atlantic and susceptible/resistant S. commersonii by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). As expected, we could detect the triose SGAs alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in susceptible S. tuberosum cv. Atlantic, but we found a remarkable difference in the SGA profile of resistant and susceptible S. commersonii. We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4). These results suggest that the triose SGAs present in susceptible CGN18024_3 are modified to produce the tetraose SGAs in resistant CGN18024_1, by addition of an extra glucose or xylose moiety."

			"context": "Studies on alpha-tomatine and avenacin A-1 show that changes to the sugar moiety of these saponins from tomato and oat, respectively, can affect their toxicity. Tomato and oat pathogens produce enzymes that can detoxify these compounds through removal of one or more glycosyl groups. The degradation products of saponins can also suppress plant defence responses. Conversely, here we show that the resistance of S. commersonii is based on the addition of a glycosyl group to a triose saponin from S. commersonii. There is large variation in both the aglycone and the sugar moiety of SGAs from wild Solanum, with likely over 100 distinct SGAs produced in tubers. This diversity suggests a pressure to evolve novel molecules, possibly to resist detoxification or other tolerance mechanisms, reminiscent of the molecular arms race that drives the evolution of plant immune receptors. Thus, wild Solanum germplasm is not only a rich source of immune receptors, it also provides a promising source of natural defence molecules. Studies of how pathogens that naturally occur on S. commersonii, or other Solanum species producing tetraose SGAs, can tolerate SGAs produced by their hosts could help judge the durability of this type of resistance."

S. tuberosum typically produces the triose SGAs alpha-solanine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Rha) and alpha-chaconine (solanidine-Glu-Rha-Rha), while five major tetraose SGAs were previously identified in S. commersonii: commersonine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), dehydrocommersonine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), demissine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), dehydrodemissine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), and alpha-tomatine (tomatidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). To test if SGAs can explain resistance of S. commersonii, we measured SGA content in leaves from Atlantic and susceptible/resistant S. commersonii by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). As expected, we could detect the triose SGAs alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in susceptible S. tuberosum cv. Atlantic, but we found a remarkable difference in the SGA profile of resistant and susceptible S. commersonii. We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4). These results suggest that the triose SGAs present in susceptible CGN18024_3 are modified to produce the tetraose SGAs in resistant CGN18024_1, by addition of an extra glucose or xylose moiety."

			"context": "Two genes coding for putative GTs are located within the rearrangement of the resistant haplotype. The corresponding allele from the susceptible haplotype contains a frameshift mutation, leading to a truncated protein (Figure 2:figure supplement 7). Several other short ORFs with homology to GTs were predicted in the resistant haplotype, but ScGTR1 (S. commersonii GT linked to resistance 1) and ScGTR2 are the only full-length genes in the region. Reads from the BSR-Seq experiment show that both genes are expressed in bulks of resistant progeny and not in susceptible progeny (Figure 2b), suggesting a putative role for these genes in causing resistance. ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are homologous genes with a high similarity (the predicted proteins that they encode share 97% amino acid identity). We compared the predicted amino acid sequences with previously characterised GTs and found that they share some similarity with GTs with a role in zeatin biosynthesis and with GAME17, an enzyme involved in biosynthesis of the SGA alpha-tomatine typically found in tomato (; Figure 2:figure supplement 8, Supplementary file 2).\nStudies on alpha-tomatine and avenacin A-1 show that changes to the sugar moiety of these saponins from tomato and oat, respectively, can affect their toxicity. Tomato and oat pathogens produce enzymes that can detoxify these compounds through removal of one or more glycosyl groups. The degradation products of saponins can also suppress plant defence responses. Conversely, here we show that the resistance of S. commersonii is based on the addition of a glycosyl group to a triose saponin from S. commersonii. There is large variation in both the aglycone and the sugar moiety of SGAs from wild Solanum, with likely over 100 distinct SGAs produced in tubers. This diversity suggests a pressure to evolve novel molecules, possibly to resist detoxification or other tolerance mechanisms, reminiscent of the molecular arms race that drives the evolution of plant immune receptors. Thus, wild Solanum germplasm is not only a rich source of immune receptors, it also provides a promising source of natural defence molecules. Studies of how pathogens that naturally occur on S. commersonii, or other Solanum species producing tetraose SGAs, can tolerate SGAs produced by their hosts could help judge the durability of this type of resistance."

To test if resistance of S. commersonii to A. solani can be explained by a host-specific defence compound, we performed a growth inhibition assay using crude leaf extract from resistant and susceptible S. commersonii. Leaf material was added to PDA plates to equal 5% (wt/vol) and autoclaved (at 121 C) or semi-sterilised at 60 C. Interestingly, leaf material from resistant CGN18024_1 strongly inhibited growth of A. solani isolate altNL03003, while we did not see any growth inhibition on plates containing leaves from susceptible CGN18024_3 (Figure 3a). Remarkably, ample contamination with diverse fungi appeared after a few days on the plates containing semi-sterilised leaves from susceptible S. commersonii but not on plates with leaves from CGN18024_1 (Figure 3a). Thus, leaves from CGN18024_1 contain compounds that can inhibit growth of a variety of fungi besides A. solani."

S. tuberosum typically produces the triose SGAs alpha-solanine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Rha) and alpha-chaconine (solanidine-Glu-Rha-Rha), while five major tetraose SGAs were previously identified in S. commersonii: commersonine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), dehydrocommersonine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), demissine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), dehydrodemissine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), and alpha-tomatine (tomatidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). To test if SGAs can explain resistance of S. commersonii, we measured SGA content in leaves from Atlantic and susceptible/resistant S. commersonii by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). As expected, we could detect the triose SGAs alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in susceptible S. tuberosum cv. Atlantic, but we found a remarkable difference in the SGA profile of resistant and susceptible S. commersonii. We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4). These results suggest that the triose SGAs present in susceptible CGN18024_3 are modified to produce the tetraose SGAs in resistant CGN18024_1, by addition of an extra glucose or xylose moiety."

S. tuberosum typically produces the triose SGAs alpha-solanine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Rha) and alpha-chaconine (solanidine-Glu-Rha-Rha), while five major tetraose SGAs were previously identified in S. commersonii: commersonine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), dehydrocommersonine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), demissine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), dehydrodemissine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), and alpha-tomatine (tomatidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl).

As expected, we could detect the triose SGAs alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in susceptible S. tuberosum cv. Atlantic, but we found a remarkable difference in the SGA profile of resistant and susceptible S. commersonii. We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4). These results suggest that the triose SGAs present in susceptible CGN18024_3 are modified to produce the tetraose SGAs in resistant CGN18024_1, by addition of an extra glucose or xylose moiety."

The discovery of S. commersonii genotypes with and without tetraose SGAs provides us with unique insight in the role of these compounds in plant immunity. Similar compounds are produced in Solanum species such as S. chacoense, S. chomatophilum, S. oplocense, S. paucisectum, and S. piurae, which may explain why these (or their descendants) display resistance to A. solani or CPB. The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato.

We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4). These results suggest that the triose SGAs present in susceptible CGN18024_3 are modified to produce the tetraose SGAs in resistant CGN18024_1, by addition of an extra glucose or xylose moiety."

			"context": "Solanum leaves usually contain SGAs, which are known phytoanticipins against fungi and other plant parasites. S. tuberosum typically produces the triose SGAs alpha-solanine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Rha) and alpha-chaconine (solanidine-Glu-Rha-Rha), while five major tetraose SGAs were previously identified in S. commersonii: commersonine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), dehydrocommersonine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), demissine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), dehydrodemissine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), and alpha-tomatine (tomatidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). To test if SGAs can explain resistance of S. commersonii, we measured SGA content in leaves from Atlantic and susceptible/resistant S. commersonii by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). As expected, we could detect the triose SGAs alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in susceptible S. tuberosum cv. Atlantic, but we found a remarkable difference in the SGA profile of resistant and susceptible S. commersonii. We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4). These results suggest that the triose SGAs present in susceptible CGN18024_3 are modified to produce the tetraose SGAs in resistant CGN18024_1, by addition of an extra glucose or xylose moiety.\nBiosynthesis of SGAs in Solanum is controlled by many genes. The discovery of S. commersonii genotypes with and without tetraose SGAs provides us with unique insight in the role of these compounds in plant immunity. Similar compounds are produced in Solanum species such as S. chacoense, S. chomatophilum, S. oplocense, S. paucisectum, and S. piurae, which may explain why these (or their descendants) display resistance to A. solani or CPB. The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato. The biosynthesis pathways leading to the production of these major SGAs from cultivated potato and tomato have largely been elucidated in recent years and it was found that the underlying genes occur in conserved clusters. This knowledge and the similarities between SGAs from S. commersonii and cultivated potato/tomato will help to identify the missing genes from the pathway through comparative genomics."

			"context": "Solanum leaves usually contain SGAs, which are known phytoanticipins against fungi and other plant parasites. S. tuberosum typically produces the triose SGAs alpha-solanine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Rha) and alpha-chaconine (solanidine-Glu-Rha-Rha), while five major tetraose SGAs were previously identified in S. commersonii: commersonine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), dehydrocommersonine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), demissine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), dehydrodemissine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), and alpha-tomatine (tomatidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). To test if SGAs can explain resistance of S. commersonii, we measured SGA content in leaves from Atlantic and susceptible/resistant S. commersonii by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). As expected, we could detect the triose SGAs alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in susceptible S. tuberosum cv. Atlantic, but we found a remarkable difference in the SGA profile of resistant and susceptible S. commersonii. We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4). These results suggest that the triose SGAs present in susceptible CGN18024_3 are modified to produce the tetraose SGAs in resistant CGN18024_1, by addition of an extra glucose or xylose moiety.\nLeptine and dehydrocommersonine SGAs from wild potato relatives have previously been linked to resistance to insects such as CPB. To see if the SGAs from S. commersonii can protect against insects as well, we performed a test with larvae of a CPB genotype collected in the Netherlands on wildtype CGN18024_1/CGN18024_3 and on CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1 or ScGTR2 (Figure 4b). Wildtype CGN18024_3 is susceptible to the CPB genotype that was tested, but CGN18024_1 and CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1 or ScGTR2 are resistant, as illustrated by a very low larvae weight and survival (Figure 4c). Thus, the conversion of triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 to tetraose SGAs produced by CGN18024_1, carried out by both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2, can provide protection against A. solani as well as CPB (Figure 4a-d)."

To test if SGAs can explain resistance of S. commersonii, we measured SGA content in leaves from Atlantic and susceptible/resistant S. commersonii by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). As expected, we could detect the triose SGAs alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in susceptible S. tuberosum cv. Atlantic, but we found a remarkable difference in the SGA profile of resistant and susceptible S. commersonii. We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4). These results suggest that the triose SGAs present in susceptible CGN18024_3 are modified to produce the tetraose SGAs in resistant CGN18024_1, by addition of an extra glucose or xylose moiety."

We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4). These results suggest that the triose SGAs present in susceptible CGN18024_3 are modified to produce the tetraose SGAs in resistant CGN18024_1, by addition of an extra glucose or xylose moiety."

			"context": "Solanum leaves usually contain SGAs, which are known phytoanticipins against fungi and other plant parasites. S. tuberosum typically produces the triose SGAs alpha-solanine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Rha) and alpha-chaconine (solanidine-Glu-Rha-Rha), while five major tetraose SGAs were previously identified in S. commersonii: commersonine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), dehydrocommersonine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), demissine (demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), dehydrodemissine (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl), and alpha-tomatine (tomatidine-Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). To test if SGAs can explain resistance of S. commersonii, we measured SGA content in leaves from Atlantic and susceptible/resistant S. commersonii by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). As expected, we could detect the triose SGAs alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in susceptible S. tuberosum cv. Atlantic, but we found a remarkable difference in the SGA profile of resistant and susceptible S. commersonii. We detected tetraose SGAs in resistant S. commersonii CGN18024_1, whereas susceptible S. commersonii CGN18024_3 accumulates triose SGAs (Figure 4a and Supplementary files 3 and 4). The mass spectra of the four major tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii correspond to (dehydro-) commersonine and (dehydro-) demissine, matching the data from previous studies. Notably, the mass spectra of the two major SGAs from susceptible CGN18024_3 correspond to the triose precursors of these SGAs (solanidine-Gal-Glu-Glu and demissidine-Gal-Glu-Glu, respectively) (Supplementary files 3 and 4). These results suggest that the triose SGAs present in susceptible CGN18024_3 are modified to produce the tetraose SGAs in resistant CGN18024_1, by addition of an extra glucose or xylose moiety."

'Atlantic' and wildtype (WT) CGN18024_3 contain only triose SGAs. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3, resulting in a commertetraose (Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose, resulting in a lycotetraose (Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). Each boxplot displays the data of three seperate measurements (b) WT CGN18024_1/CGN18024_3 and CGN18024_3 transformants were inoculated with Alternaria solani altNL03003. Three plants of each genotype were tested and three leaves per plants were inoculated with six 10 microl droplets with spore suspension each. Lesions diameters were measured 5 days post inoculation. Significant differences with WT CGN18024_3 are indicated with asterisks (Welch's two-sample t-test, ***p < 0.001). ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 can both complement resistance to A. solani in CGN18024_3, as the lesion sizes produced on CGN18024_3 transformants are comparable to resistant CGN18024_1. (c) Three plants per genotype were challenged with five Colorado potato beetle larvae each. The tetraose SGAs produced by ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 can provide resistance to Colorado potato beetle, as indicated by reduced larvae survival and total larvae weight. Significant differences with WT CGN18024_3 are indicated with asterisks (Welch's two-sample t-test, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001). (d) Putative structures of SGAs detected in CGN18024_1 and CGN18024_3, based on previous studies. CGN18024_3 produces triose SGAs and is susceptible to Colorado potato beetle and A. solani. ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 from CGN18024_1 convert these triose SGAs from susceptible S. commersonii to tetraose SGAs, through the addition of a glucose or xylose moiety, respectively. Both sugar additions can provide resistance to Colorado potato beetle and A. solani."

			"context": "To investigate a possible role for ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in the production of tetraose SGAs from CGN18024_1 and their link to resistance, we generated stable transformants of ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in triose SGA producing CGN18024_3 (Figure 4:figure supplement 1). UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4).\nData are visualised with boxplots, with horizonal lines indicating median values and individual measurements plotted on top. (a) Tetraose SGAs were detected in resistant CGN18024_1 and in CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1/ScGTR2. Susceptible S. tuberosum cv.

Each boxplot displays the data of three seperate measurements (b) WT CGN18024_1/CGN18024_3 and CGN18024_3 transformants were inoculated with Alternaria solani altNL03003. Three plants of each genotype were tested and three leaves per plants were inoculated with six 10 microl droplets with spore suspension each. Lesions diameters were measured 5 days post inoculation. Significant differences with WT CGN18024_3 are indicated with asterisks (Welch's two-sample t-test, ***p < 0.001). ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 can both complement resistance to A. solani in CGN18024_3, as the lesion sizes produced on CGN18024_3 transformants are comparable to resistant CGN18024_1. (c) Three plants per genotype were challenged with five Colorado potato beetle larvae each. The tetraose SGAs produced by ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 can provide resistance to Colorado potato beetle, as indicated by reduced larvae survival and total larvae weight.

This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4)."

The discovery of S. commersonii genotypes with and without tetraose SGAs provides us with unique insight in the role of these compounds in plant immunity. Similar compounds are produced in Solanum species such as S. chacoense, S. chomatophilum, S. oplocense, S. paucisectum, and S. piurae, which may explain why these (or their descendants) display resistance to A. solani or CPB. The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato. The biosynthesis pathways leading to the production of these major SGAs from cultivated potato and tomato have largely been elucidated in recent years and it was found that the underlying genes occur in conserved clusters. This knowledge and the similarities between SGAs from S. commersonii and cultivated potato/tomato will help to identify the missing genes from the pathway through comparative genomics."

			"justification": "commertetraose is detected in resistant CGN18024_1 and in CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1/ScGTR2, which are resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003",
			"context": "To investigate a possible role for ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in the production of tetraose SGAs from CGN18024_1 and their link to resistance, we generated stable transformants of ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in triose SGA producing CGN18024_3 (Figure 4:figure supplement 1). UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4).\nData are visualised with boxplots, with horizonal lines indicating median values and individual measurements plotted on top. (a) Tetraose SGAs were detected in resistant CGN18024_1 and in CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1/ScGTR2. Susceptible S. tuberosum cv. 'Atlantic' and wildtype (WT) CGN18024_3 contain only triose SGAs. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3, resulting in a commertetraose (Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose, resulting in a lycotetraose (Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). Each boxplot displays the data of three seperate measurements (b) WT CGN18024_1/CGN18024_3 and CGN18024_3 transformants were inoculated with Alternaria solani altNL03003. Three plants of each genotype were tested and three leaves per plants were inoculated with six 10 microl droplets with spore suspension each. Lesions diameters were measured 5 days post inoculation. Significant differences with WT CGN18024_3 are indicated with asterisks (Welch's two-sample t-test, ***p < 0.001). ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 can both complement resistance to A. solani in CGN18024_3, as the lesion sizes produced on CGN18024_3 transformants are comparable to resistant CGN18024_1. (c) Three plants per genotype were challenged with five Colorado potato beetle larvae each. The tetraose SGAs produced by ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 can provide resistance to Colorado potato beetle, as indicated by reduced larvae survival and total larvae weight. Significant differences with WT CGN18024_3 are indicated with asterisks (Welch's two-sample t-test, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001). (d) Putative structures of SGAs detected in CGN18024_1 and CGN18024_3, based on previous studies. CGN18024_3 produces triose SGAs and is susceptible to Colorado potato beetle and A. solani. ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 from CGN18024_1 convert these triose SGAs from susceptible S. commersonii to tetraose SGAs, through the addition of a glucose or xylose moiety, respectively. Both sugar additions can provide resistance to Colorado potato beetle and A. solani."

UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4)."

The discovery of S. commersonii genotypes with and without tetraose SGAs provides us with unique insight in the role of these compounds in plant immunity. Similar compounds are produced in Solanum species such as S. chacoense, S. chomatophilum, S. oplocense, S. paucisectum, and S. piurae, which may explain why these (or their descendants) display resistance to A. solani or CPB. The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato. The biosynthesis pathways leading to the production of these major SGAs from cultivated potato and tomato have largely been elucidated in recent years and it was found that the underlying genes occur in conserved clusters. This knowledge and the similarities between SGAs from S. commersonii and cultivated potato/tomato will help to identify the missing genes from the pathway through comparative genomics."

			"context": "To investigate a possible role for ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in the production of tetraose SGAs from CGN18024_1 and their link to resistance, we generated stable transformants of ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in triose SGA producing CGN18024_3 (Figure 4:figure supplement 1). UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4).\nData are visualised with boxplots, with horizonal lines indicating median values and individual measurements plotted on top.

UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4)."

(c) Three plants per genotype were challenged with five Colorado potato beetle larvae each. The tetraose SGAs produced by ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 can provide resistance to Colorado potato beetle, as indicated by reduced larvae survival and total larvae weight. Significant differences with WT CGN18024_3 are indicated with asterisks (Welch's two-sample t-test, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001). (d) Putative structures of SGAs detected in CGN18024_1 and CGN18024_3, based on previous studies. CGN18024_3 produces triose SGAs and is susceptible to Colorado potato beetle and A. solani. ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 from CGN18024_1 convert these triose SGAs from susceptible S. commersonii to tetraose SGAs, through the addition of a glucose or xylose moiety, respectively.

The discovery of S. commersonii genotypes with and without tetraose SGAs provides us with unique insight in the role of these compounds in plant immunity.

The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato. The biosynthesis pathways leading to the production of these major SGAs from cultivated potato and tomato have largely been elucidated in recent years and it was found that the underlying genes occur in conserved clusters. This knowledge and the similarities between SGAs from S. commersonii and cultivated potato/tomato will help to identify the missing genes from the pathway through comparative genomics."

			"context": "To investigate a possible role for ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in the production of tetraose SGAs from CGN18024_1 and their link to resistance, we generated stable transformants of ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in triose SGA producing CGN18024_3 (Figure 4:figure supplement 1). UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4).\nData are visualised with boxplots, with horizonal lines indicating median values and individual measurements plotted on top. (a) Tetraose SGAs were detected in resistant CGN18024_1 and in CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1/ScGTR2. Susceptible S. tuberosum cv. 'Atlantic' and wildtype (WT) CGN18024_3 contain only triose SGAs. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3, resulting in a commertetraose (Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose, resulting in a lycotetraose (Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). Each boxplot displays the data of three seperate measurements (b) WT CGN18024_1/CGN18024_3 and CGN18024_3 transformants were inoculated with Alternaria solani altNL03003. Three plants of each genotype were tested and three leaves per plants were inoculated with six 10 microl droplets with spore suspension each. Lesions diameters were measured 5 days post inoculation. Significant differences with WT CGN18024_3 are indicated with asterisks (Welch's two-sample t-test, ***p < 0.001). ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 can both complement resistance to A. solani in CGN18024_3, as the lesion sizes produced on CGN18024_3 transformants are comparable to resistant CGN18024_1.

UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4)."

The discovery of S. commersonii genotypes with and without tetraose SGAs provides us with unique insight in the role of these compounds in plant immunity. Similar compounds are produced in Solanum species such as S. chacoense, S. chomatophilum, S. oplocense, S. paucisectum, and S. piurae, which may explain why these (or their descendants) display resistance to A. solani or CPB. The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato. The biosynthesis pathways leading to the production of these major SGAs from cultivated potato and tomato have largely been elucidated in recent years and it was found that the underlying genes occur in conserved clusters. This knowledge and the similarities between SGAs from S. commersonii and cultivated potato/tomato will help to identify the missing genes from the pathway through comparative genomics."

			"context": "To investigate a possible role for ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in the production of tetraose SGAs from CGN18024_1 and their link to resistance, we generated stable transformants of ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in triose SGA producing CGN18024_3 (Figure 4:figure supplement 1). UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4)."

			"context": "To investigate a possible role for ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in the production of tetraose SGAs from CGN18024_1 and their link to resistance, we generated stable transformants of ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in triose SGA producing CGN18024_3 (Figure 4:figure supplement 1). UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4).\nLeptine and dehydrocommersonine SGAs from wild potato relatives have previously been linked to resistance to insects such as CPB. To see if the SGAs from S. commersonii can protect against insects as well, we performed a test with larvae of a CPB genotype collected in the Netherlands on wildtype CGN18024_1/CGN18024_3 and on CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1 or ScGTR2 (Figure 4b). Wildtype CGN18024_3 is susceptible to the CPB genotype that was tested, but CGN18024_1 and CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1 or ScGTR2 are resistant, as illustrated by a very low larvae weight and survival (Figure 4c). Thus, the conversion of triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 to tetraose SGAs produced by CGN18024_1, carried out by both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2, can provide protection against A. solani as well as CPB (Figure 4a-d)."

'Atlantic' and wildtype (WT) CGN18024_3 contain only triose SGAs.\nOverexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3, resulting in a commertetraose (Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose, resulting in a lycotetraose (Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl).\nEach boxplot displays the data of three seperate measurements (b) WT CGN18024_1/CGN18024_3 and CGN18024_3 transformants were inoculated with Alternaria solani altNL03003.\nCGN18024_3 produces triose SGAs and is susceptible to Colorado potato beetle and A. solani.\nScGTR1 and ScGTR2 from CGN18024_1 convert these triose SGAs from susceptible S. commersonii to tetraose SGAs, through the addition of a glucose or xylose moiety, respectively.\nBoth sugar additions can provide resistance to Colorado potato beetle and A. solani.\nTo investigate a possible role for ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in the production of tetraose SGAs from CGN18024_1 and their link to resistance, we generated stable transformants of ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in triose SGA producing CGN18024_3 (Figure 4:figure supplement 1).\nUPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a).\nStrikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities.\nOverexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d).\nThis in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase."
