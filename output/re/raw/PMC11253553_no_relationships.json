			"context": "In our study, high temperature suppressed the herbivory-induced accumulation of jasmonates, primary and specialized metabolites in potato plants. The decrease in soluble sugar level and transcript accumulation is possibly attributed to a reduction in photosynthesis parameters due to stomata closure under elevated temperature. Also, our previous research show that the emission of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in potato (cv. Lishu 6) leaves were enhanced by high temperature treatment, which subsequently affected the plants' attractiveness to the P. operculella and its egg parasitoid wasp. This distinction might be due to the use of different cultivars, whilst it is also possible that plants may differentially regulate the production of volatile and nonvolatile secondary compounds under elevated temperature. While the alteration of levels of herbivory-induced secondary metabolites (i.e.: polyphenol oxidase and glucosinolates) by high temperature have been found in many plants including tomato and watermelon, evidence for the suppression of herbivory-induced primary metabolism by high temperature remains scarce. We propose that this suppression is related to the JA-signaling in potato plants, since the herbivory-induced JA biosynthetic genes and JA accumulations were suppressed by high temperature. However, whether suppressing JA-signaling could benefit the plant response to high temperature remains to be clarified in future."

While elevated temperature is known to directly affect herbivore growth, it remains largely unclear if it indirectly influences herbivore performance by affecting the host plant they feed on. In this study, we investigated how transient exposure to high temperature influences plant herbivory-induced defenses at the transcript and metabolic level. To this end, we studied the interaction between potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants and the larvae of the potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) under different temperature regimes. We found that P. operculella larvae grew heavier on leaves co-stressed by high temperature and insect herbivory than on leaves pre-stressed by herbivory alone. We also observed that high temperature treatments altered phylotranscriptomic patterns upon herbivory, which changed from an evolutionary hourglass pattern, in which transcriptomic responses at early and late time points after elicitation are more variable than the ones in the middle, to a vase pattern. Specifically, transcripts of many herbivory-induced genes in the early and late defense stage were suppressed by HT treatment, whereas those in the intermediate stage peaked earlier. Additionally, we observed that high temperature impaired the induction of jasmonates and defense compounds upon herbivory. Moreover, using jasmonate-reduced (JA-reduced, irAOC) and -elevated (JA-Ile-elevated, irCYP94B3s) potato plants, we showed that high temperature suppresses JA signaling mediated plant-induced defense to herbivore attack. Thus, our study provides evidences on how temperature reprograms plant-induced defense to herbivores."

			"context": "The iTAI and iTDI presented different patterns when plants were exposed to high temperatures, which altered this phylotranscriptomic pattern from an hourglass- to a vase-shape pattern, suggesting high temperatures recruit different gene sets during the process of activation of herbivory-induced defenses. This change in phylotranscriptomic pattern was partially due to the suppression of several JA-associated, herbivory-induced genes when potato plants were exposed to high temperatures (Fig. 3E). We further performed GO enrichment analysis on herbivory-induced genes under control and high temperatures (Fig. S10). At the early stage (0.5 h and 1 h) of herbivory-induced defense process, while CT genes (early defense signaling gene group) were enriched in 'response to endogenous stimulus', 'response to hormone', and 'kinase activity'. HT genes were enriched in 'metabolic process' and 'photosynthesis'. Since the HT genes were more involved in metabolism than signaling, the phylotranscriptomic pattern under HT was predominantly ancient (lower iTAI) and more conserved (lower iTDI) at 0.5 h and 1 h. Similarly, CT genes (primary and specialized metabolism gene groups) at the intermediate (5 h) and late (11 h) stages of herbivory-induced defense process had different GO terms compared with HT genes. Since the HT genes were less enriched in metabolic process than CT genes, the phylotranscriptomic pattern under HT was predominantly younger (high iTAI) and more divergent (high iTDI) at 5 h and 11 h. These results suggested that HT's differential selection of the three plant's defense gene groups at each stage of herbivory-induced defense process led to different gene group functions form CT's, resulting in a different phylotranscriptomic pattern (Fig. 8). An alternative hypothesis is several plant genes associated with heat stress response, which contain large numbers of ancient and conserved genes, were activated by high temperature exposure, especially in the early stage (0.5 h and 1 h) post the herbivory, and revealing how high temperature influence all stages of herbivory-induced gene activation in future will promote the identification of key regulators in this complex signaling cascade."

			"context": "To gain insight into the suppression of JA-regulated defense responses associated with increased P. operculella larval weight gain under high temperature, we used JA-reduced irAOC and JA-Ile-elevated irCYP94B3s mutants in insect detached leaf bioassays to investigate the contribution of JA signaling in this context. Firstly, we observed that P. operculella larvae reared on WT leaves previously subjected to insect herbivory accumulated more biomass under high temperature than control temperature. However, this difference between the two temperature regimes was eliminated when the larvae were grown on herbivory-induced detached JA-reduced leaves. Secondly, unlike the reduced biomass on JA-Ile-elevated plants under control temperature, P. operculella larvae accumulated similar biomass on JA-Ile-elevated plants with WT plants under high temperature. We concluded that high temperature diminished plants' herbivory-induced defense and JA signaling participated in this regulation; thus leading to higher biomass of P. operculella under high temperature. Similar results were reported in recent studies that the defense mechanism of plants against insect pests is diminished by climate change in aspects of warming-mediated host-plant quality such as poor-nutrient foliage, decreased defensive compounds, and increased sensitivity to attacks. Future research efforts should focus on strategies to enhance crop defenses against herbivores in warming ecosystems."

According to previous studies in other plant-insect interacting systems, positive effects of elevated ambient temperature on plants' herbivore defense were also observed. Potato is a cool-weather crop whose physiology is strongly affected by high temperature. It is likely that a 'resource reallocation' happened in potato plants when high temperature and herbivory stresses coexisted. In plants that are more adapted to eco-niche with warmer temperature, a different pattern may occur for their defense signaling activation, resource allocation and defensive secondary compounds production up on herbivory."

The decrease in soluble sugar level and transcript accumulation is possibly attributed to a reduction in photosynthesis parameters due to stomata closure under elevated temperature. Also, our previous research show that the emission of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in potato (cv. Lishu 6) leaves were enhanced by high temperature treatment, which subsequently affected the plants' attractiveness to the P. operculella and its egg parasitoid wasp. This distinction might be due to the use of different cultivars, whilst it is also possible that plants may differentially regulate the production of volatile and nonvolatile secondary compounds under elevated temperature. While the alteration of levels of herbivory-induced secondary metabolites (i.e.: polyphenol oxidase and glucosinolates) by high temperature have been found in many plants including tomato and watermelon, evidence for the suppression of herbivory-induced primary metabolism by high temperature remains scarce. We propose that this suppression is related to the JA-signaling in potato plants, since the herbivory-induced JA biosynthetic genes and JA accumulations were suppressed by high temperature. However, whether suppressing JA-signaling could benefit the plant response to high temperature remains to be clarified in future."

While elevated temperature is known to directly affect herbivore growth, it remains largely unclear if it indirectly influences herbivore performance by affecting the host plant they feed on. In this study, we investigated how transient exposure to high temperature influences plant herbivory-induced defenses at the transcript and metabolic level. To this end, we studied the interaction between potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants and the larvae of the potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) under different temperature regimes. We found that P. operculella larvae grew heavier on leaves co-stressed by high temperature and insect herbivory than on leaves pre-stressed by herbivory alone. We also observed that high temperature treatments altered phylotranscriptomic patterns upon herbivory, which changed from an evolutionary hourglass pattern, in which transcriptomic responses at early and late time points after elicitation are more variable than the ones in the middle, to a vase pattern. Specifically, transcripts of many herbivory-induced genes in the early and late defense stage were suppressed by HT treatment, whereas those in the intermediate stage peaked earlier. Additionally, we observed that high temperature impaired the induction of jasmonates and defense compounds upon herbivory. Moreover, using jasmonate-reduced (JA-reduced, irAOC) and -elevated (JA-Ile-elevated, irCYP94B3s) potato plants, we showed that high temperature suppresses JA signaling mediated plant-induced defense to herbivore attack. Thus, our study provides evidences on how temperature reprograms plant-induced defense to herbivores."

			"context": "In our study, high temperature suppressed the herbivory-induced accumulation of jasmonates, primary and specialized metabolites in potato plants. The decrease in soluble sugar level and transcript accumulation is possibly attributed to a reduction in photosynthesis parameters due to stomata closure under elevated temperature. Also, our previous research show that the emission of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in potato (cv. Lishu 6) leaves were enhanced by high temperature treatment, which subsequently affected the plants' attractiveness to the P. operculella and its egg parasitoid wasp. This distinction might be due to the use of different cultivars, whilst it is also possible that plants may differentially regulate the production of volatile and nonvolatile secondary compounds under elevated temperature. While the alteration of levels of herbivory-induced secondary metabolites (i.e.: polyphenol oxidase and glucosinolates) by high temperature have been found in many plants including tomato and watermelon, evidence for the suppression of herbivory-induced primary metabolism by high temperature remains scarce. We propose that this suppression is related to the JA-signaling in potato plants, since the herbivory-induced JA biosynthetic genes and JA accumulations were suppressed by high temperature. However, whether suppressing JA-signaling could benefit the plant response to high temperature remains to be clarified in future."

In this study, we investigated how transient exposure to high temperature influences plant herbivory-induced defenses at the transcript and metabolic level.

We found that P. operculella larvae grew heavier on leaves co-stressed by high temperature and insect herbivory than on leaves pre-stressed by herbivory alone. We also observed that high temperature treatments altered phylotranscriptomic patterns upon herbivory, which changed from an evolutionary hourglass pattern, in which transcriptomic responses at early and late time points after elicitation are more variable than the ones in the middle, to a vase pattern. Specifically, transcripts of many herbivory-induced genes in the early and late defense stage were suppressed by HT treatment, whereas those in the intermediate stage peaked earlier. Additionally, we observed that high temperature impaired the induction of jasmonates and defense compounds upon herbivory. Moreover, using jasmonate-reduced (JA-reduced, irAOC) and -elevated (JA-Ile-elevated, irCYP94B3s) potato plants, we showed that high temperature suppresses JA signaling mediated plant-induced defense to herbivore attack.

In this study, we investigated how transient exposure to high temperature influences plant herbivory-induced defenses at the transcript and metabolic level. To this end, we studied the interaction between potato (Solanum tuberosum) plants and the larvae of the potato tuber moth (Phthorimaea operculella) under different temperature regimes. We found that P. operculella larvae grew heavier on leaves co-stressed by high temperature and insect herbivory than on leaves pre-stressed by herbivory alone. We also observed that high temperature treatments altered phylotranscriptomic patterns upon herbivory, which changed from an evolutionary hourglass pattern, in which transcriptomic responses at early and late time points after elicitation are more variable than the ones in the middle, to a vase pattern. Specifically, transcripts of many herbivory-induced genes in the early and late defense stage were suppressed by HT treatment, whereas those in the intermediate stage peaked earlier. Additionally, we observed that high temperature impaired the induction of jasmonates and defense compounds upon herbivory. Moreover, using jasmonate-reduced (JA-reduced, irAOC) and -elevated (JA-Ile-elevated, irCYP94B3s) potato plants, we showed that high temperature suppresses JA signaling mediated plant-induced defense to herbivore attack. Thus, our study provides evidences on how temperature reprograms plant-induced defense to herbivores."

			"context": "In our study, high temperature suppressed the herbivory-induced accumulation of jasmonates, primary and specialized metabolites in potato plants. The decrease in soluble sugar level and transcript accumulation is possibly attributed to a reduction in photosynthesis parameters due to stomata closure under elevated temperature. Also, our previous research show that the emission of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in potato (cv. Lishu 6) leaves were enhanced by high temperature treatment, which subsequently affected the plants' attractiveness to the P. operculella and its egg parasitoid wasp. This distinction might be due to the use of different cultivars, whilst it is also possible that plants may differentially regulate the production of volatile and nonvolatile secondary compounds under elevated temperature. While the alteration of levels of herbivory-induced secondary metabolites (i.e.: polyphenol oxidase and glucosinolates) by high temperature have been found in many plants including tomato and watermelon, evidence for the suppression of herbivory-induced primary metabolism by high temperature remains scarce. We propose that this suppression is related to the JA-signaling in potato plants, since the herbivory-induced JA biosynthetic genes and JA accumulations were suppressed by high temperature. However, whether suppressing JA-signaling could benefit the plant response to high temperature remains to be clarified in future."

For instance, the concentration of many specialized metabolites, including flavonoids, phenolics, and terpenoids, are altered in plants grown under high temperatures, which subsequently affects the performance of herbivores on plants. This is partially attributed to high temperature-driven modification of the activity of plant enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of these metabolites. Apart from endogenous metabolites, the emission of volatile organic compounds is also modulated by temperature. In potato, a cool-weather crop, for instance, high temperature enhances the emission of one key volatile organic compound (ss-caryophyllene) from herbivory-induced leaves, which reduces the attractiveness of this plant to P. operculella adult moths but enhances its recruitment to the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma chilonis of this pest, indicating that temperature can affect potato's induced defenses against these insects."

			"context": "Plant's herbivory-induced defense responses are fined-tuned by phytohormonal signaling cascades in Planta. Among them, jasmonates are master regulators of several herbivory-induced defense responses. We observed that JA, JA-biosynthesis and JA-signaling genes, are strongly induced upon herbivory in potato plants. Alterations in herbivory-induced JA were usually accompanied by changed accumulation of primary and specialized metabolites in many plants. In our study, the primary (soluble sugars) and secondary (SGAs, TPI) metabolites, together with their biosynthetic genes, are strongly induced upon herbivory. Meanwhile, levels of these metabolites and their related biosynthetic genes were strongly activated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment (Fig. S5 and S6), indicating that JA-signaling also plays an important role in potato's induced defense against the P. operculella (Fig. 8). Indeed, suppressing herbivory-induced JA accumulation in JA-reduced plants significantly weakened their defense against P. operculella, whereas enhancing herbivory-induced JA-Ile accumulation in JA-Ile-elevated plants and applying MeJA both strengthened their defense against P. operculella. We demonstrated that JA signaling plays an important role in plants' defense against P. operculella. Previous studies indicated that JA signaling is also related with HT. However, the co-stress-induced pattern by herbivory and high temperature remained unclear."
