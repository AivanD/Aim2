			"context": "Tomato is the highest value fruit and vegetable crop worldwide, yet produces alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting anti-nutritional steroidal glycoalkaloid (SGA) involved in plant defense. A suite of modifications during tomato fruit maturation and ripening converts alpha-tomatine to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A. This important metabolic shift prevents bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit. While the enzymes catalyzing glycosylation and hydroxylation reactions in the Esculeoside A pathway have been resolved, the proposed acetylating step remains, to date, elusive. Here, we discovered that GAME36 (GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM36), a BAHD-type acyltransferase catalyzes SGA-acetylation in cultivated and wild tomatoes. This finding completes the elucidation of the core Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway in ripe tomato, allowing reconstitution of Esculeoside A production in heterologous microbial and plant hosts. The involvement of GAME36 in bitter SGA detoxification pathway points to a key role in the evolution of sweet-tasting tomato as well as in the domestication and breeding of modern cultivated tomato fruit.\nFollowing the successful in vitro reconstruction experiments, we attempted to reconstruct Esculeoside A biosynthesis in planta by infiltrating N. benthamiana leaves with Agrobacterium harboring the respective GAME genes and alpha-tomatine as a substrate (alpha-tomatine infiltrated three days post infiltration). Transient co-expression of tomato GAME31, GAME36, GAME40 and GAME5 in N. benthamiana leaves supplemented with alpha-tomatine generated Esculeoside A (Supplementary Fig. 15). As observed in our in vitro experiments, co-infiltration of the respective tomato GAME enzymes in a sequential manner (according to the pathway reaction order, see Fig. 1) and subsequent supplementation with alpha-tomatine resulted in formation of the corresponding Esculeoside A pathway intermediates (Supplementary Fig. 15). Furthermore, we designed additional co-infiltration combinations of GAME genes in the same transient expression experiment to check whether respective GAME enzymes can act promiscuously on pathway intermediates, and form new SGA derivatives. We did not observe the accumulation of any other SGAs apart from the expected ones in such reconstitution experiments, therefore, eliminating the possibility of cross-reactivity of GAME enzymes on Esculeoside A pathway intermediates. These results validate the sequential function of GAME31, GAME36, GAME40, and GAME5 enzymes in the production of tomato fruit ripening-associated SGAs."

			"context": "Tomato is the highest value fruit and vegetable crop worldwide, yet produces alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting anti-nutritional steroidal glycoalkaloid (SGA) involved in plant defense. A suite of modifications during tomato fruit maturation and ripening converts alpha-tomatine to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A. This important metabolic shift prevents bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit. While the enzymes catalyzing glycosylation and hydroxylation reactions in the Esculeoside A pathway have been resolved, the proposed acetylating step remains, to date, elusive. Here, we discovered that GAME36 (GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM36), a BAHD-type acyltransferase catalyzes SGA-acetylation in cultivated and wild tomatoes. This finding completes the elucidation of the core Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway in ripe tomato, allowing reconstitution of Esculeoside A production in heterologous microbial and plant hosts. The involvement of GAME36 in bitter SGA detoxification pathway points to a key role in the evolution of sweet-tasting tomato as well as in the domestication and breeding of modern cultivated tomato fruit."

These GAME proteins belong to three different enzyme families namely, 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenases [2-ODDs; i.e., GAME31 and GAME40), BAHD acyltransferases (GAME36) and Uridine diphosphate (UDP) glycosyltransferases (UGTs: GAME5).\nWe next asked whether the four recombinant GAME enzymes could metabolize alpha-tomatine to produce Esculeoside A. We reconstructed the Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway by adding the four purified enzymes expressed in E.

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"justification": "The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time.",
			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

			"context": "Thus, the versatile roles displayed by tomato BAHD proteins including GAME36 are reflected in the phylogenetic analysis, which suggests that the evolution of BAHD family members drive the expansion of metabolic diversification in tomato.\nThe drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades.\nYet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening.\nHere we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway.\nConsequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit.\nAt this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine.\nWe believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19).\nThe ripening-associated changes in SGA metabolism (conversion of alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A) are controlled by the ripening-inducing phytohormone ethylene, and exogenous ethylene treatments of tomato fruit accelerated this chemical shift (higher Esculeoside A and lower alpha-tomatine).\nOn the contrary, ripening-impaired mutants such as ripening-inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor) and Never-ripe (Nr) showed reduced levels of Esculeoside A, but accumulated its pathway intermediates (e.g., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine) compared to wild type fruit.\nThe earlier steps in the Esculeoside A pathway carried out by GAME31 and GAME36 appear to be ethylene-independent as expression of these genes was not affected in ripening impaired tomato mutants.\nThis ripening associated chemical shift in SGAs metabolism was likely selected during tomato fruit domestication and breeding to prevent the accumulation of alpha-tomatine in ripe fruit that results in bitter flavor.\nEvolutionary wise, reducing the toxicity of fruit could facilitate feeding by frugivores and consequently promote seed dispersal."

Our results expand the understanding of the ripening-associated metabolic shift in SGA composition assuring non-bitter forms of ripe tomato fruits as consumed at present.\nStarting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1)."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

(2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening.\nBoth reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A)."

			"context": "Tomato is the highest value fruit and vegetable crop worldwide, yet produces alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting anti-nutritional steroidal glycoalkaloid (SGA) involved in plant defense. A suite of modifications during tomato fruit maturation and ripening converts alpha-tomatine to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A. This important metabolic shift prevents bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit. While the enzymes catalyzing glycosylation and hydroxylation reactions in the Esculeoside A pathway have been resolved, the proposed acetylating step remains, to date, elusive. Here, we discovered that GAME36 (GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM36), a BAHD-type acyltransferase catalyzes SGA-acetylation in cultivated and wild tomatoes. This finding completes the elucidation of the core Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway in ripe tomato, allowing reconstitution of Esculeoside A production in heterologous microbial and plant hosts. The involvement of GAME36 in bitter SGA detoxification pathway points to a key role in the evolution of sweet-tasting tomato as well as in the domestication and breeding of modern cultivated tomato fruit."

SGAs protect the plant against a broad range of pathogens and herbivores and have potent pharmacological activity in mammals. However, some SGAs are considered as anti-nutritional to humans due to their high toxicity (e.g., alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in potato), bitterness and unpleasant sensations (e.g., alpha-tomatine in tomato). Despite the presence of these notorious substances that exert a negative impact on nutritional quality and marketability, tomato is the highest-value fruit and vegetable crop (FAO; World Food and Agriculture-statistical yearbook 2021) consumed on a daily basis worldwide.

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "GAME: GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM; Glu: Glucose; Gal: Galactose; Xyl: Xylose; Rha: Rhamnose; Ac: Acetoxy.\nalpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato.\nTo prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis.\nDuring the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway).\nGORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening.\nThe relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit.\nThus, the versatile roles displayed by tomato BAHD proteins including GAME36 are reflected in the phylogenetic analysis, which suggests that the evolution of BAHD family members drive the expansion of metabolic diversification in tomato.\nThe drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades.\nYet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening.\nHere we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway.\nConsequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit.\nAt this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine."

Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

Micro Tom); shown in blue] and SpGAME36 (S. pennellii, in tan, brown) enzymes convert alpha-tomatine (c) and dehydrotomatine (d) to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively when assayed together with SlGAME31 (each enzyme produced separately in E. coli cells) in in vitro assays.",
			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3).\na Profiling of acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine in different tissue types of cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum cv. Micro Tom). b Acetylation of hydroxytomatine by the recombinant tomato GAME36 (Solyc08g075210) enzyme produced in E. coli cells (marked in red). The control reaction (shown in black) was performed with hydroxytomatine using extracts from E. coli cells transformed with an empty pET28 vector. The recombinant GAME36 enzyme produces the same acetoxytomatine peak as typically observed in green fruit extracts of tomato (in blue). Aligned ion chromatograms were obtained by LC-MS analysis (short, 15 min. run). The isolated hydroxytomatine compound for in vitro assays contained additional isomers as impurities (shown by asterisks). c, d The recombinant SlGAME36 [S. lycopersicum (cv. Micro Tom); shown in blue] and SpGAME36 (S. pennellii, in tan, brown) enzymes convert alpha-tomatine (c) and dehydrotomatine (d) to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively when assayed together with SlGAME31 (each enzyme produced separately in E. coli cells). The control reaction (in black) contained the respective substrate and the protein extracts of empty vector-transformed E. coli cells. Individual assays of SlGAME31, SlGAME36 and SpGAME36 recombinant enzymes are shown in red, dark purple and turquoise colors, respectively.

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

The recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was able to utilize hydroxytomatine (GAME31 assay product) and all aliphatic acyl donors (except malonyl CoA) tested to generate corresponding acylated SGA metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, SlGAME36 did not show any acyltransferase activity when aromatic CoA thioesters were used as acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 7). We further set up an additional experiment in which recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was incubated with hydroxytomatine (acceptor substrate) and mixture of five acyl CoAs (0.2 mM each CoA; acetyl-, butyryl-, isovaleryl-, hexanoyl- and octanoyl-) in a single tube. The acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA were efficiently used as acyl donor with hydroxytomatine, and formed over 93% acylated SGAs together compared to all acylated SGA metabolites generated in the enzyme assay (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In case of hydroxysolamargine as a substrate, we also noted the dominance of acetylated- and butyrylated- SGAs as assay products, suggesting the preference of SlGAME36 enzyme for acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA compared to other acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 8b). We also examined whether GAME36 could catalyze freely reversible reaction, as reported previously for several other BAHD enzymes. Interestingly, GAME36 enzyme did not catalyze reversible reaction when incubated with acetoxytomatine (typical assay product) and CoA as substrates (Supplementary Fig. 9). In addition, we did not observe any spontaneous formation of hydroxytomatine when acetoxytomatine was incubated with CoA, but without GAME36 enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 9)."

In vitro steady-state kinetics analysis suggested that SlGAME36 had a higher catalytic efficiency with hydroxytomatine (native substrate from tomato; kcat/Km = 250.52 min-1 muM-1) than hydroxysolamargine (SGA substrate from eggplant; kcat/Km = 41.22 min-1 muM-1) (Fig. 3a, b). In case of acyl donors, enzyme kinetic assays showed preferred specificity toward acetyl CoA over butyryl CoA (kcat/Km = 108.23 min-1 muM-1 for acetyl CoA compared with kcat/Km = 40.91 min-1 muM-1 for butyryl CoA) (Fig. 3c, d). Overall, our results demonstrated the promiscuity of the GAME36 enzyme in vitro by acylating hydroxy-SGAs using various aliphatic acyl CoA donors. Hydroxytomatine and hydroxysolamargine substrates used in the biochemical characterization of GAME36 were isolated from in vitro enzyme assays using GAME31 with either alpha-tomatine or alpha-solamargine, respectively (See Methods section for more details)."

These GAME proteins belong to three different enzyme families namely, 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenases [2-ODDs; i.e., GAME31 and GAME40), BAHD acyltransferases (GAME36) and Uridine diphosphate (UDP) glycosyltransferases (UGTs: GAME5). We next asked whether the four recombinant GAME enzymes could metabolize alpha-tomatine to produce Esculeoside A. We reconstructed the Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway by adding the four purified enzymes expressed in E. Coli (i.e., GAME31, GAME36, GAME40, and GAME5), alpha-tomatine and the appropriate co-factors (alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, Fe2+, acetyl-CoA and UDP-glucose) in a single tube. We noted that this reaction produced not only the final product, Esculeoside A but also all pathway intermediates (hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) (Fig. 6) that accumulate in vivo in numerous cultivated and wild tomato species. As the order of reactions of the Esculeoside A pathway is confirmed here as proposed previously, stepwise reconstitution experiments were performed by sequentially adding the respective GAME enzymes, alpha-tomatine, and relevant co-factors in a single tube. Sequential assays produced explicitly the expected pathway intermediates (e.g., hydroxytomatine) associated with Esculeoside A pathway (Fig. 6)."

As observed in our in vitro experiments, co-infiltration of the respective tomato GAME enzymes in a sequential manner (according to the pathway reaction order, see Fig. 1) and subsequent supplementation with alpha-tomatine resulted in formation of the corresponding Esculeoside A pathway intermediates (Supplementary Fig. 15). Furthermore, we designed additional co-infiltration combinations of GAME genes in the same transient expression experiment to check whether respective GAME enzymes can act promiscuously on pathway intermediates, and form new SGA derivatives. We did not observe the accumulation of any other SGAs apart from the expected ones in such reconstitution experiments, therefore, eliminating the possibility of cross-reactivity of GAME enzymes on Esculeoside A pathway intermediates. These results validate the sequential function of GAME31, GAME36, GAME40, and GAME5 enzymes in the production of tomato fruit ripening-associated SGAs."

			"justification": "in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit.",
			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

			"context": "The uncovered GAME36 activity together with the previously characterized GAME enzymes (GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5) completes the SGA pathway branch converting alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. These GAME proteins belong to three different enzyme families namely, 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenases [2-ODDs; i.e., GAME31 and GAME40), BAHD acyltransferases (GAME36) and Uridine diphosphate (UDP) glycosyltransferases (UGTs: GAME5).\nWe next asked whether the four recombinant GAME enzymes could metabolize alpha-tomatine to produce Esculeoside A. We reconstructed the Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway by adding the four purified enzymes expressed in E. Coli (i.e., GAME31, GAME36, GAME40, and GAME5), alpha-tomatine and the appropriate co-factors (alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, Fe2+, acetyl-CoA and UDP-glucose) in a single tube.\nWe noted that this reaction produced not only the final product, Esculeoside A but also all pathway intermediates (hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) (Fig. 6) that accumulate in vivo in numerous cultivated and wild tomato species.\nThis might be a source of bitterness in commercial tomato varieties.\nThus, the understanding Esculeoside A biosynthesis could facilitate the development of genetic markers or genome modifications that will maximize the conversion of alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A and consequently increase fruit sweetness.\nMoreover, as SGAs and particularly Esculeoside A, have been reported to possess health-promoting properties, results of our study could be applicable for the production of high-value products through metabolic engineering approaches."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades.\nYet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening.\nBoth reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A).\nThe last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit.\nInterestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway.\nFurthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit.\nOn the contrary, ripening-impaired mutants such as ripening-inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor) and Never-ripe (Nr) showed reduced levels of Esculeoside A, but accumulated its pathway intermediates (e.g., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine) compared to wild type fruit.\nThese results in the tomato mutant lines suggest that the late steps in Esculeoside A pathway depend on ethylene during ripening.\nIn fact, GAME40 (also known as E8) catalyzing the penultimate step in Esculeoside A pathway is a known ethylene-responsive gene during fruit ripening and regulated by ethylene and several other transcription factors involved in fruit ripening.\nMoreover, the expression of GAME5 transcript (associated with last step in Esculeoside A pathway) was severely affected in ripening mutants compared to wild type fruit, where it is highly upregulated at the breaker stage (Supplementary Fig. 20)."

			"context": "Tomato is the highest value fruit and vegetable crop worldwide, yet produces alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting anti-nutritional steroidal glycoalkaloid (SGA) involved in plant defense. A suite of modifications during tomato fruit maturation and ripening converts alpha-tomatine to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A. This important metabolic shift prevents bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit. While the enzymes catalyzing glycosylation and hydroxylation reactions in the Esculeoside A pathway have been resolved, the proposed acetylating step remains, to date, elusive. Here, we discovered that GAME36 (GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM36), a BAHD-type acyltransferase catalyzes SGA-acetylation in cultivated and wild tomatoes. This finding completes the elucidation of the core Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway in ripe tomato, allowing reconstitution of Esculeoside A production in heterologous microbial and plant hosts. The involvement of GAME36 in bitter SGA detoxification pathway points to a key role in the evolution of sweet-tasting tomato as well as in the domestication and breeding of modern cultivated tomato fruit."

			"justification": "the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps...the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine",
			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"justification": "The text states that Esculeoside A is formed through a series of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway, indicating that it is a product within this pathway.",
			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

			"context": "In fact, these precursor SGAs were the predominant SGAs in red fruit of the game36 mutant tomato plants.\nIn parallel, SGAs produced downstream of hydroxytomatine (i.e., acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) towards Esculeoside A were not detected in ripe game36 fruit (apart from mutant line #50 that showed negligible levels).\nYet, we observed minimal levels of Esculeoside A in red ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines (Fig. 5d).\nFurthermore, we detected a substantial decrease in di-hydroxytomatine SGA (a likely derivative of hydroxytomatine) in comparison to wild type ripe fruit (Fig. 5d).\nThe last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit.\nInterestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway.\nFurthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit.\nApart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1).\nHaving recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1).\nWe envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway).\nA BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways.\nTo identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets.\nUnfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization.\nMass to charge (m/z) is shown for alpha-tomatine and the assay products (i.e., Esculeoside A pathway intermediates).\nThe uncovered GAME36 activity together with the previously characterized GAME enzymes (GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5) completes the SGA pathway branch converting alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. These GAME proteins belong to three different enzyme families namely, 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenases [2-ODDs; i.e., GAME31 and GAME40), BAHD acyltransferases (GAME36) and Uridine diphosphate (UDP) glycosyltransferases (UGTs: GAME5).\nWe next asked whether the four recombinant GAME enzymes could metabolize alpha-tomatine to produce Esculeoside A. We reconstructed the Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway by adding the four purified enzymes expressed in E. Coli (i.e., GAME31, GAME36, GAME40, and GAME5), alpha-tomatine and the appropriate co-factors (alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, Fe2+, acetyl-CoA and UDP-glucose) in a single tube.\nWe noted that this reaction produced not only the final product, Esculeoside A but also all pathway intermediates (hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) (Fig. 6) that accumulate in vivo in numerous cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

(2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening.\nBoth reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A).\nHere we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway.\nConsequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit.\nAt this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine.\nWe believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19).\nThe ripening-associated changes in SGA metabolism (conversion of alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A) are controlled by the ripening-inducing phytohormone ethylene, and exogenous ethylene treatments of tomato fruit accelerated this chemical shift (higher Esculeoside A and lower alpha-tomatine).\nOn the contrary, ripening-impaired mutants such as ripening-inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor) and Never-ripe (Nr) showed reduced levels of Esculeoside A, but accumulated its pathway intermediates (e.g., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine) compared to wild type fruit.\nThese results in the tomato mutant lines suggest that the late steps in Esculeoside A pathway depend on ethylene during ripening.\nIn fact, GAME40 (also known as E8) catalyzing the penultimate step in Esculeoside A pathway is a known ethylene-responsive gene during fruit ripening and regulated by ethylene and several other transcription factors involved in fruit ripening.\nMoreover, the expression of GAME5 transcript (associated with last step in Esculeoside A pathway) was severely affected in ripening mutants compared to wild type fruit, where it is highly upregulated at the breaker stage (Supplementary Fig. 20)."

To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

(2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening.\nBoth reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A)."

			"context": "Tomato is the highest value fruit and vegetable crop worldwide, yet produces alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting anti-nutritional steroidal glycoalkaloid (SGA) involved in plant defense. A suite of modifications during tomato fruit maturation and ripening converts alpha-tomatine to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A. This important metabolic shift prevents bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit. While the enzymes catalyzing glycosylation and hydroxylation reactions in the Esculeoside A pathway have been resolved, the proposed acetylating step remains, to date, elusive. Here, we discovered that GAME36 (GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM36), a BAHD-type acyltransferase catalyzes SGA-acetylation in cultivated and wild tomatoes. This finding completes the elucidation of the core Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway in ripe tomato, allowing reconstitution of Esculeoside A production in heterologous microbial and plant hosts. The involvement of GAME36 in bitter SGA detoxification pathway points to a key role in the evolution of sweet-tasting tomato as well as in the domestication and breeding of modern cultivated tomato fruit."

			"context": "This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis.\nWe believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19).\nThe ripening-associated changes in SGA metabolism (conversion of alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A) are controlled by the ripening-inducing phytohormone ethylene, and exogenous ethylene treatments of tomato fruit accelerated this chemical shift (higher Esculeoside A and lower alpha-tomatine).\nOn the contrary, ripening-impaired mutants such as ripening-inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor) and Never-ripe (Nr) showed reduced levels of Esculeoside A, but accumulated its pathway intermediates (e.g., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine) compared to wild type fruit.\nThese results in the tomato mutant lines suggest that the late steps in Esculeoside A pathway depend on ethylene during ripening."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit.\nAt this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine.\nThe last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit.\nInterestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway.\nFurthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit.\nWe believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19).\nThe ripening-associated changes in SGA metabolism (conversion of alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A) are controlled by the ripening-inducing phytohormone ethylene, and exogenous ethylene treatments of tomato fruit accelerated this chemical shift (higher Esculeoside A and lower alpha-tomatine).\nOn the contrary, ripening-impaired mutants such as ripening-inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor) and Never-ripe (Nr) showed reduced levels of Esculeoside A, but accumulated its pathway intermediates (e.g., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine) compared to wild type fruit.\nThese results in the tomato mutant lines suggest that the late steps in Esculeoside A pathway depend on ethylene during ripening.\nIn fact, GAME40 (also known as E8) catalyzing the penultimate step in Esculeoside A pathway is a known ethylene-responsive gene during fruit ripening and regulated by ethylene and several other transcription factors involved in fruit ripening."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

Our results expand the understanding of the ripening-associated metabolic shift in SGA composition assuring non-bitter forms of ripe tomato fruits as consumed at present.\nStarting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1).\nMoreover, Yang et al. proposed a possible application of Esculeoside A as a functional supplement for diabetes treatment using mice model.\nAnother study by Zhou et al. showed the role of Esculeoside A in ameliorating atopic dermatitis in mice (IC50 9 microM) via blocking hyaluronidase activity in vitro and in vivo.\nIt is now established that alpha-tomatine provides a bitter taste as exemplified nicely by the early work of Charles Rick and co-workers as well as ours on the gorky mutant."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

Furthermore, we designed additional co-infiltration combinations of GAME genes in the same transient expression experiment to check whether respective GAME enzymes can act promiscuously on pathway intermediates, and form new SGA derivatives. We did not observe the accumulation of any other SGAs apart from the expected ones in such reconstitution experiments, therefore, eliminating the possibility of cross-reactivity of GAME enzymes on Esculeoside A pathway intermediates.

			"context": "Acetoxytomatine is one of the few SGAs commonly detected in almost every cultivated and wild tomato species. Yet, Iijima et al. (2013) reported the absence of acetoxytomatine and further downstream SGAs, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A in ripe fruit of the wild tomato S. neorickii (accession LA2133), but detected high levels of neorickiioside B (i.e., hydroxytomatine) in the same tissue. This suggested that biosynthesis of Esculeoside A from alpha-tomatine is inhibited at the acetylation step of hydroxytomatine in S. neorickii (LA2133). Here, we examined SGAs content in leaves and ripe fruit of S. neorickii (LA2133) and the cultivated tomato. Notably, very high levels of acetoxytomatine were observed in the leaves of S. neorickii compared to leaves of the cultivated tomato (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Moreover, we detected a set of SGAs associated with fruit ripening (i.e., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A) in ripe fruit of S. neorickii (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c). The results indicate that Esculeoside A biosynthesis indeed takes place in S. neorickii (LA2133) fruit that likely contains the corresponding enzyme activities required for its biosynthesis. We next compared GAME36 expression levels in leaves of cultivated tomato and S. neorickii. GAME36 showed very weak expression in leaf tissue of cultivated tomato (Supplementary Fig. 10d) correlating with trace levels of acetoxytomatine in the leaves of this genotype (Supplementary Fig. 10a). S. neorickii displayed very high GAME36 expression as compared to the cultivated tomato leaves (Supplementary Fig. 10d) which explains the presence of very high acetoxytomatine levels in this accession (Supplementary Fig. 10a).\nFollowing the successful in vitro reconstruction experiments, we attempted to reconstruct Esculeoside A biosynthesis in planta by infiltrating N. benthamiana leaves with Agrobacterium harboring the respective GAME genes and alpha-tomatine as a substrate (alpha-tomatine infiltrated three days post infiltration). Transient co-expression of tomato GAME31, GAME36, GAME40 and GAME5 in N. benthamiana leaves supplemented with alpha-tomatine generated Esculeoside A (Supplementary Fig. 15). As observed in our in vitro experiments, co-infiltration of the respective tomato GAME enzymes in a sequential manner (according to the pathway reaction order, see Fig. 1) and subsequent supplementation with alpha-tomatine resulted in formation of the corresponding Esculeoside A pathway intermediates (Supplementary Fig. 15). Furthermore, we designed additional co-infiltration combinations of GAME genes in the same transient expression experiment to check whether respective GAME enzymes can act promiscuously on pathway intermediates, and form new SGA derivatives. We did not observe the accumulation of any other SGAs apart from the expected ones in such reconstitution experiments, therefore, eliminating the possibility of cross-reactivity of GAME enzymes on Esculeoside A pathway intermediates. These results validate the sequential function of GAME31, GAME36, GAME40, and GAME5 enzymes in the production of tomato fruit ripening-associated SGAs."

GAME36 showed very weak expression in leaf tissue of cultivated tomato (Supplementary Fig. 10d) correlating with trace levels of acetoxytomatine in the leaves of this genotype (Supplementary Fig. 10a). S. neorickii displayed very high GAME36 expression as compared to the cultivated tomato leaves (Supplementary Fig. 10d) which explains the presence of very high acetoxytomatine levels in this accession (Supplementary Fig. 10a)."

During tomato fruit maturation and ripening, the bitter-tasting alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter Esculeoside A. Some commercial cultivars contain relatively substantial alpha-tomatine levels in ripe fruit. This might be a source of bitterness in commercial tomato varieties. Thus, the understanding Esculeoside A biosynthesis could facilitate the development of genetic markers or genome modifications that will maximize the conversion of alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A and consequently increase fruit sweetness. Moreover, as SGAs and particularly Esculeoside A, have been reported to possess health-promoting properties, results of our study could be applicable for the production of high-value products through metabolic engineering approaches."

We did not observe the accumulation of any other SGAs apart from the expected ones in such reconstitution experiments, therefore, eliminating the possibility of cross-reactivity of GAME enzymes on Esculeoside A pathway intermediates.

SGAs protect the plant against a broad range of pathogens and herbivores and have potent pharmacological activity in mammals. However, some SGAs are considered as anti-nutritional to humans due to their high toxicity (e.g., alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine in potato), bitterness and unpleasant sensations (e.g., alpha-tomatine in tomato). Despite the presence of these notorious substances that exert a negative impact on nutritional quality and marketability, tomato is the highest-value fruit and vegetable crop (FAO; World Food and Agriculture-statistical yearbook 2021) consumed on a daily basis worldwide. During domestication and breeding, tomato fruit with increased sweetness along with reduced SGA content have been selected for.\nBesides their role in defense in plants and anti-nutritional effects to humans, several SGAs from tomato (alpha-tomatine), potato (alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine) and eggplant (alpha-solasonine and alpha-solamargine) are known for their anti-carcinogenic potential. Several studies reported multiple therapeutic applications of Esculeoside A in human health. For example, Fujiwara et al. isolated Esculeoside A from ripe tomato fruits, and showed its potent cytotoxic activity against MCF7 (human breast cancer cell) and B16F2F (mouse melanoma cell) cells. The GI50 values of Esculeoside A were reported to be 13.3 and 7.9 microM against MCF7 and B16F2F, respectively. Moreover, Yang et al. proposed a possible application of Esculeoside A as a functional supplement for diabetes treatment using mice model. Another study by Zhou et al. showed the role of Esculeoside A in ameliorating atopic dermatitis in mice (IC50 9 microM) via blocking hyaluronidase activity in vitro and in vivo."

Several studies reported multiple therapeutic applications of Esculeoside A in human health. For example, Fujiwara et al. isolated Esculeoside A from ripe tomato fruits, and showed its potent cytotoxic activity against MCF7 (human breast cancer cell) and B16F2F (mouse melanoma cell) cells. The GI50 values of Esculeoside A were reported to be 13.3 and 7.9 microM against MCF7 and B16F2F, respectively. Moreover, Yang et al. proposed a possible application of Esculeoside A as a functional supplement for diabetes treatment using mice model. Another study by Zhou et al. showed the role of Esculeoside A in ameliorating atopic dermatitis in mice (IC50 9 microM) via blocking hyaluronidase activity in vitro and in vivo."

			"context": "Acetoxytomatine is one of the few SGAs commonly detected in almost every cultivated and wild tomato species. Yet, Iijima et al. (2013) reported the absence of acetoxytomatine and further downstream SGAs, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A in ripe fruit of the wild tomato S. neorickii (accession LA2133), but detected high levels of neorickiioside B (i.e., hydroxytomatine) in the same tissue. This suggested that biosynthesis of Esculeoside A from alpha-tomatine is inhibited at the acetylation step of hydroxytomatine in S. neorickii (LA2133). Here, we examined SGAs content in leaves and ripe fruit of S. neorickii (LA2133) and the cultivated tomato. Notably, very high levels of acetoxytomatine were observed in the leaves of S. neorickii compared to leaves of the cultivated tomato (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Moreover, we detected a set of SGAs associated with fruit ripening (i.e., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A) in ripe fruit of S. neorickii (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c). The results indicate that Esculeoside A biosynthesis indeed takes place in S. neorickii (LA2133) fruit that likely contains the corresponding enzyme activities required for its biosynthesis. We next compared GAME36 expression levels in leaves of cultivated tomato and S. neorickii. GAME36 showed very weak expression in leaf tissue of cultivated tomato (Supplementary Fig. 10d) correlating with trace levels of acetoxytomatine in the leaves of this genotype (Supplementary Fig. 10a). S. neorickii displayed very high GAME36 expression as compared to the cultivated tomato leaves (Supplementary Fig. 10d) which explains the presence of very high acetoxytomatine levels in this accession (Supplementary Fig. 10a).\nDuring tomato fruit ripening (from green up to the red ripe stage), alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine are converted to Esculeoside A and dehydro-esculeoside A, respectively. To investigate the impact of GAME36 activity on ripening-associated SGA metabolism, we compared the SGA profile of wild type and game36 tomato fruits. Analysis of green fruit from game36 mutant lines showed dramatic accumulation of hydroxytomatine and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine compared with wild-type green fruit (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, no major change in alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine levels was observed in green fruit of the game36 mutant lines. In contrast, we did not detect acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine, the latter SGA derived from acetoxytomatine through additional hydroxylation, in game36 green fruit (Fig. 5b, refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for SGA pathway). Thus, reduced GAME36 activity in the green fruit resulted in the complete loss of acetoxy-SGAs with concomitant buildup of its precursor SGAs. In red, ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines, we detected massive accumulation of hydroxytomatine, hydroxytomatine isomer, and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine SGAs in comparison to wild-type fruit at the same stage (Fig. 5c). In fact, these precursor SGAs were the predominant SGAs in red fruit of the game36 mutant tomato plants. In parallel, SGAs produced downstream of hydroxytomatine (i.e., acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) towards Esculeoside A were not detected in ripe game36 fruit (apart from mutant line #50 that showed negligible levels). Yet, we observed minimal levels of Esculeoside A in red ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, we detected a substantial decrease in di-hydroxytomatine SGA (a likely derivative of hydroxytomatine) in comparison to wild type ripe fruit (Fig. 5d). Altogether, our in vivo and in vitro results confirmed that tomato GAME36 catalyzes the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine in the Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway."

We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

This indicates that ASATs are not directly involved in the degradation of acetoxy-hydroxytomatine, but rather GAME40 is involved in its generation. However, since ASATs are mentioned in the context of acylsugar biosynthesis, and given the context of the pathway, it can be inferred that ASATs are involved in a different biosynthetic pathway and not directly in the degradation of acetoxy-hydroxytomatine.

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

			"context": "Acetoxytomatine is one of the few SGAs commonly detected in almost every cultivated and wild tomato species. Yet, Iijima et al. (2013) reported the absence of acetoxytomatine and further downstream SGAs, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A in ripe fruit of the wild tomato S. neorickii (accession LA2133), but detected high levels of neorickiioside B (i.e., hydroxytomatine) in the same tissue. This suggested that biosynthesis of Esculeoside A from alpha-tomatine is inhibited at the acetylation step of hydroxytomatine in S. neorickii (LA2133). Here, we examined SGAs content in leaves and ripe fruit of S. neorickii (LA2133) and the cultivated tomato. Notably, very high levels of acetoxytomatine were observed in the leaves of S. neorickii compared to leaves of the cultivated tomato (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Moreover, we detected a set of SGAs associated with fruit ripening (i.e., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A) in ripe fruit of S. neorickii (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c). The results indicate that Esculeoside A biosynthesis indeed takes place in S. neorickii (LA2133) fruit that likely contains the corresponding enzyme activities required for its biosynthesis. We next compared GAME36 expression levels in leaves of cultivated tomato and S. neorickii. GAME36 showed very weak expression in leaf tissue of cultivated tomato (Supplementary Fig. 10d) correlating with trace levels of acetoxytomatine in the leaves of this genotype (Supplementary Fig. 10a). S. neorickii displayed very high GAME36 expression as compared to the cultivated tomato leaves (Supplementary Fig. 10d) which explains the presence of very high acetoxytomatine levels in this accession (Supplementary Fig. 10a).\nalpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs.

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

To investigate the impact of GAME36 activity on ripening-associated SGA metabolism, we compared the SGA profile of wild type and game36 tomato fruits. Analysis of green fruit from game36 mutant lines showed dramatic accumulation of hydroxytomatine and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine compared with wild-type green fruit (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, no major change in alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine levels was observed in green fruit of the game36 mutant lines. In contrast, we did not detect acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine, the latter SGA derived from acetoxytomatine through additional hydroxylation, in game36 green fruit (Fig. 5b, refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for SGA pathway). Thus, reduced GAME36 activity in the green fruit resulted in the complete loss of acetoxy-SGAs with concomitant buildup of its precursor SGAs. In red, ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines, we detected massive accumulation of hydroxytomatine, hydroxytomatine isomer, and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine SGAs in comparison to wild-type fruit at the same stage (Fig. 5c). In fact, these precursor SGAs were the predominant SGAs in red fruit of the game36 mutant tomato plants. In parallel, SGAs produced downstream of hydroxytomatine (i.e., acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) towards Esculeoside A were not detected in ripe game36 fruit (apart from mutant line #50 that showed negligible levels). Yet, we observed minimal levels of Esculeoside A in red ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, we detected a substantial decrease in di-hydroxytomatine SGA (a likely derivative of hydroxytomatine) in comparison to wild type ripe fruit (Fig. 5d). Altogether, our in vivo and in vitro results confirmed that tomato GAME36 catalyzes the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine in the Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway."

We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages).

Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

On the contrary, ripening-impaired mutants such as ripening-inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor) and Never-ripe (Nr) showed reduced levels of Esculeoside A, but accumulated its pathway intermediates (e.g., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine) compared to wild type fruit. These results in the tomato mutant lines suggest that the late steps in Esculeoside A pathway depend on ethylene during ripening. In fact, GAME40 (also known as E8) catalyzing the penultimate step in Esculeoside A pathway is a known ethylene-responsive gene during fruit ripening and regulated by ethylene and several other transcription factors involved in fruit ripening. Moreover, the expression of GAME5 transcript (associated with last step in Esculeoside A pathway) was severely affected in ripening mutants compared to wild type fruit, where it is highly upregulated at the breaker stage (Supplementary Fig. 20). The earlier steps in the Esculeoside A pathway carried out by GAME31 and GAME36 appear to be ethylene-independent as expression of these genes was not affected in ripening impaired tomato mutants. This ripening associated chemical shift in SGAs metabolism was likely selected during tomato fruit domestication and breeding to prevent the accumulation of alpha-tomatine in ripe fruit that results in bitter flavor. Evolutionary wise, reducing the toxicity of fruit could facilitate feeding by frugivores and consequently promote seed dispersal."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit.

This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis.

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"justification": "The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively",
			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"justification": "GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine",
			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development.

This dataset was obtained from tomato (cv. Micro Tom) skin and flesh tissues of five fruit developmental stages (immature green, mature green, orange, breaker and red ripe) and various other tissues (young leaf, flower buds, young flower petals and roots). The selected BAHD candidate genes included those that were preferentially expressed in the immature and mature green stages of fruit development versus the red ripe stage [skin and/or flesh with fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) >= 15)]. Additional filtering by transcript expression level in flower buds' tissue (FPKM >= 10) that typically accumulate acetoxytomatine reduced this list to 11 BAHD candidates for further functional characterization (Supplementary Fig. 4). To test their role in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we cloned each BAHD candidate from the cultivated tomato and expressed it separately in E. coli cells. Purified proteins were then assayed for in vitro acyltransferase activity with hydroxytomatine as a substrate (isolated from transgenic tomato plants overexpressing the GAME31 gene). Analysis of assay mixtures using a short LC-MS method (15 min. per sample) revealed that one candidate (Solyc08g075210) generated an acetylated compound that is acetoxytomatine (m/z 1092.54; C52H85NO23) when incubated with hydroxytomatine (m/z 1050.50; C50H83NO22) and acetyl-CoA as acyl donor (Fig. 2b). The acetoxytomatine peak observed here was identical to the one detected in the green fruit extracts of cultivated tomato (Fig. 2b). Thus, in vitro enzyme assays confirmed that candidate Solyc08g075210, named here GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM36 (GAME36), can catalyze the biosynthesis of acetoxytomatine."

This dataset was obtained from tomato (cv. Micro Tom) skin and flesh tissues of five fruit developmental stages (immature green, mature green, orange, breaker and red ripe) and various other tissues (young leaf, flower buds, young flower petals and roots). The selected BAHD candidate genes included those that were preferentially expressed in the immature and mature green stages of fruit development versus the red ripe stage [skin and/or flesh with fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) >= 15)]. Additional filtering by transcript expression level in flower buds' tissue (FPKM >= 10) that typically accumulate acetoxytomatine reduced this list to 11 BAHD candidates for further functional characterization (Supplementary Fig. 4). To test their role in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we cloned each BAHD candidate from the cultivated tomato and expressed it separately in E. coli cells. Purified proteins were then assayed for in vitro acyltransferase activity with hydroxytomatine as a substrate (isolated from transgenic tomato plants overexpressing the GAME31 gene). Analysis of assay mixtures using a short LC-MS method (15 min. per sample) revealed that one candidate (Solyc08g075210) generated an acetylated compound that is acetoxytomatine (m/z 1092.54; C52H85NO23) when incubated with hydroxytomatine (m/z 1050.50; C50H83NO22) and acetyl-CoA as acyl donor (Fig. 2b). The acetoxytomatine peak observed here was identical to the one detected in the green fruit extracts of cultivated tomato (Fig. 2b). Thus, in vitro enzyme assays confirmed that candidate Solyc08g075210, named here GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM36 (GAME36), can catalyze the biosynthesis of acetoxytomatine."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "Directed by the metabolic profiling results, we selected 16 candidate proteins of the BAHD class (excluding the ones characterized earlier) from our in-house generated tomato transcriptome dataset (NCBI SRA: PRJNA307656). This dataset was obtained from tomato (cv. Micro Tom) skin and flesh tissues of five fruit developmental stages (immature green, mature green, orange, breaker and red ripe) and various other tissues (young leaf, flower buds, young flower petals and roots). The selected BAHD candidate genes included those that were preferentially expressed in the immature and mature green stages of fruit development versus the red ripe stage [skin and/or flesh with fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) >= 15)]. Additional filtering by transcript expression level in flower buds' tissue (FPKM >= 10) that typically accumulate acetoxytomatine reduced this list to 11 BAHD candidates for further functional characterization (Supplementary Fig. 4). To test their role in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we cloned each BAHD candidate from the cultivated tomato and expressed it separately in E. coli cells. Purified proteins were then assayed for in vitro acyltransferase activity with hydroxytomatine as a substrate (isolated from transgenic tomato plants overexpressing the GAME31 gene). Analysis of assay mixtures using a short LC-MS method (15 min. per sample) revealed that one candidate (Solyc08g075210) generated an acetylated compound that is acetoxytomatine (m/z 1092.54; C52H85NO23) when incubated with hydroxytomatine (m/z 1050.50; C50H83NO22) and acetyl-CoA as acyl donor (Fig. 2b). The acetoxytomatine peak observed here was identical to the one detected in the green fruit extracts of cultivated tomato (Fig. 2b). Thus, in vitro enzyme assays confirmed that candidate Solyc08g075210, named here GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM36 (GAME36), can catalyze the biosynthesis of acetoxytomatine.\nThe drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

(2013) reported the absence of acetoxytomatine and further downstream SGAs, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A in ripe fruit of the wild tomato S. neorickii (accession LA2133), but detected high levels of neorickiioside B (i.e., hydroxytomatine) in the same tissue. This suggested that biosynthesis of Esculeoside A from alpha-tomatine is inhibited at the acetylation step of hydroxytomatine in S. neorickii (LA2133). Here, we examined SGAs content in leaves and ripe fruit of S. neorickii (LA2133) and the cultivated tomato. Notably, very high levels of acetoxytomatine were observed in the leaves of S. neorickii compared to leaves of the cultivated tomato (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Moreover, we detected a set of SGAs associated with fruit ripening (i.e., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A) in ripe fruit of S. neorickii (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c). The results indicate that Esculeoside A biosynthesis indeed takes place in S. neorickii (LA2133) fruit that likely contains the corresponding enzyme activities required for its biosynthesis. We next compared GAME36 expression levels in leaves of cultivated tomato and S. neorickii. GAME36 showed very weak expression in leaf tissue of cultivated tomato (Supplementary Fig. 10d) correlating with trace levels of acetoxytomatine in the leaves of this genotype (Supplementary Fig. 10a). S. neorickii displayed very high GAME36 expression as compared to the cultivated tomato leaves (Supplementary Fig. 10d) which explains the presence of very high acetoxytomatine levels in this accession (Supplementary Fig. 10a)."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine.",
			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

We noted the presence of the GAME36 gene in all the selected accessions (Fig. 7a). However, in two wild accessions, S. huaylasense LA1983 and S. peruvianum LA1278, we noticed two nonsense SNPs in GAME36 (one in each accession) that introduced premature stop codons, therefore likely producing truncated, non-functional GAME36 variant proteins (Supplementary Fig. 16a). We next amplified and sequenced the GAME36 coding region from several wild tomato accessions and examined the completeness of sequences. Notably, we could only confirm the nonsense mutation in S. huaylasense LA1983, but not in S. peruvianum LA1278 (Supplementary Fig. 16b & 16c) as predicted. Thus, the nonsense SNP originally identified for GAME36 in S. peruvianum LA1278 was a sequencing discrepancy, which remained unverified by further analysis in the genome of S. peruvianum LA1278 accession. The other wild accessions including S. peruvianum LA1278 displayed full-length GAME36 sequences, encoding further full-length GAME36 proteins (Fig. 7a). We further analyzed acetoxytomatine and hydroxytomatine content in leaves of these selected wild tomato accessions. Cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum cv. Moneymaker) accumulate these SGAs in its leaves and possess functional GAME36 protein, thus was included in genomic and metabolite analysis as positive control. While acetoxytomatine was detected in almost all wild tomato species, we could not find it in S. huaylasense LA1983 accession (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, very high levels of hydroxytomatine (precursor of acetoxytomatine) were observed in S. huaylasense LA1983 accession compared to other wild species (Fig. 7c). These results suggest that the non-functional GAME36 enzyme in S. huaylasense LA1983 prevents the formation of acetoxytomatine in this accession.\na GAME36 genotype variants obtained from cultivated and wild tomato species.

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "Directed by the metabolic profiling results, we selected 16 candidate proteins of the BAHD class (excluding the ones characterized earlier) from our in-house generated tomato transcriptome dataset (NCBI SRA: PRJNA307656). This dataset was obtained from tomato (cv. Micro Tom) skin and flesh tissues of five fruit developmental stages (immature green, mature green, orange, breaker and red ripe) and various other tissues (young leaf, flower buds, young flower petals and roots). The selected BAHD candidate genes included those that were preferentially expressed in the immature and mature green stages of fruit development versus the red ripe stage [skin and/or flesh with fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) >= 15)]. Additional filtering by transcript expression level in flower buds' tissue (FPKM >= 10) that typically accumulate acetoxytomatine reduced this list to 11 BAHD candidates for further functional characterization (Supplementary Fig. 4). To test their role in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we cloned each BAHD candidate from the cultivated tomato and expressed it separately in E. coli cells. Purified proteins were then assayed for in vitro acyltransferase activity with hydroxytomatine as a substrate (isolated from transgenic tomato plants overexpressing the GAME31 gene). Analysis of assay mixtures using a short LC-MS method (15 min. per sample) revealed that one candidate (Solyc08g075210) generated an acetylated compound that is acetoxytomatine (m/z 1092.54; C52H85NO23) when incubated with hydroxytomatine (m/z 1050.50; C50H83NO22) and acetyl-CoA as acyl donor (Fig. 2b). The acetoxytomatine peak observed here was identical to the one detected in the green fruit extracts of cultivated tomato (Fig. 2b). Thus, in vitro enzyme assays confirmed that candidate Solyc08g075210, named here GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM36 (GAME36), can catalyze the biosynthesis of acetoxytomatine."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

The recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was able to utilize hydroxytomatine (GAME31 assay product) and all aliphatic acyl donors (except malonyl CoA) tested to generate corresponding acylated SGA metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, SlGAME36 did not show any acyltransferase activity when aromatic CoA thioesters were used as acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 7). We further set up an additional experiment in which recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was incubated with hydroxytomatine (acceptor substrate) and mixture of five acyl CoAs (0.2 mM each CoA; acetyl-, butyryl-, isovaleryl-, hexanoyl- and octanoyl-) in a single tube. The acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA were efficiently used as acyl donor with hydroxytomatine, and formed over 93% acylated SGAs together compared to all acylated SGA metabolites generated in the enzyme assay (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In case of hydroxysolamargine as a substrate, we also noted the dominance of acetylated- and butyrylated- SGAs as assay products, suggesting the preference of SlGAME36 enzyme for acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA compared to other acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 8b). We also examined whether GAME36 could catalyze freely reversible reaction, as reported previously for several other BAHD enzymes. Interestingly, GAME36 enzyme did not catalyze reversible reaction when incubated with acetoxytomatine (typical assay product) and CoA as substrates (Supplementary Fig. 9). In addition, we did not observe any spontaneous formation of hydroxytomatine when acetoxytomatine was incubated with CoA, but without GAME36 enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 9)."

The recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was able to utilize hydroxytomatine (GAME31 assay product) and all aliphatic acyl donors (except malonyl CoA) tested to generate corresponding acylated SGA metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, SlGAME36 did not show any acyltransferase activity when aromatic CoA thioesters were used as acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 7). We further set up an additional experiment in which recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was incubated with hydroxytomatine (acceptor substrate) and mixture of five acyl CoAs (0.2 mM each CoA; acetyl-, butyryl-, isovaleryl-, hexanoyl- and octanoyl-) in a single tube. The acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA were efficiently used as acyl donor with hydroxytomatine, and formed over 93% acylated SGAs together compared to all acylated SGA metabolites generated in the enzyme assay (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In case of hydroxysolamargine as a substrate, we also noted the dominance of acetylated- and butyrylated- SGAs as assay products, suggesting the preference of SlGAME36 enzyme for acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA compared to other acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 8b). We also examined whether GAME36 could catalyze freely reversible reaction, as reported previously for several other BAHD enzymes. Interestingly, GAME36 enzyme did not catalyze reversible reaction when incubated with acetoxytomatine (typical assay product) and CoA as substrates (Supplementary Fig. 9). In addition, we did not observe any spontaneous formation of hydroxytomatine when acetoxytomatine was incubated with CoA, but without GAME36 enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 9)."

			"justification": "in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit.",
			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1).\nHaving recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1).\nWe envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway).\nFurthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit.\nApart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway.\nDi-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits.\nThis SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway).\nIn this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"context": "Directed by the metabolic profiling results, we selected 16 candidate proteins of the BAHD class (excluding the ones characterized earlier) from our in-house generated tomato transcriptome dataset (NCBI SRA: PRJNA307656). This dataset was obtained from tomato (cv. Micro Tom) skin and flesh tissues of five fruit developmental stages (immature green, mature green, orange, breaker and red ripe) and various other tissues (young leaf, flower buds, young flower petals and roots). The selected BAHD candidate genes included those that were preferentially expressed in the immature and mature green stages of fruit development versus the red ripe stage [skin and/or flesh with fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) >= 15)]. Additional filtering by transcript expression level in flower buds' tissue (FPKM >= 10) that typically accumulate acetoxytomatine reduced this list to 11 BAHD candidates for further functional characterization (Supplementary Fig. 4). To test their role in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we cloned each BAHD candidate from the cultivated tomato and expressed it separately in E. coli cells. Purified proteins were then assayed for in vitro acyltransferase activity with hydroxytomatine as a substrate (isolated from transgenic tomato plants overexpressing the GAME31 gene). Analysis of assay mixtures using a short LC-MS method (15 min. per sample) revealed that one candidate (Solyc08g075210) generated an acetylated compound that is acetoxytomatine (m/z 1092.54; C52H85NO23) when incubated with hydroxytomatine (m/z 1050.50; C50H83NO22) and acetyl-CoA as acyl donor (Fig. 2b). The acetoxytomatine peak observed here was identical to the one detected in the green fruit extracts of cultivated tomato (Fig. 2b). Thus, in vitro enzyme assays confirmed that candidate Solyc08g075210, named here GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM36 (GAME36), can catalyze the biosynthesis of acetoxytomatine."

On the contrary, ripening-impaired mutants such as ripening-inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor) and Never-ripe (Nr) showed reduced levels of Esculeoside A, but accumulated its pathway intermediates (e.g., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine) compared to wild type fruit. These results in the tomato mutant lines suggest that the late steps in Esculeoside A pathway depend on ethylene during ripening. In fact, GAME40 (also known as E8) catalyzing the penultimate step in Esculeoside A pathway is a known ethylene-responsive gene during fruit ripening and regulated by ethylene and several other transcription factors involved in fruit ripening. Moreover, the expression of GAME5 transcript (associated with last step in Esculeoside A pathway) was severely affected in ripening mutants compared to wild type fruit, where it is highly upregulated at the breaker stage (Supplementary Fig. 20). The earlier steps in the Esculeoside A pathway carried out by GAME31 and GAME36 appear to be ethylene-independent as expression of these genes was not affected in ripening impaired tomato mutants. This ripening associated chemical shift in SGAs metabolism was likely selected during tomato fruit domestication and breeding to prevent the accumulation of alpha-tomatine in ripe fruit that results in bitter flavor. Evolutionary wise, reducing the toxicity of fruit could facilitate feeding by frugivores and consequently promote seed dispersal."

These proteins formed a distinct clade, supporting the unique divergent function of this BAHD in SGA biosynthesis. Interestingly, we detected three clustered BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato chromosome 8 spanning ~13 Kbp region that includes a single GAME36 and two truncated GAME36-like homologs (Supplementary Fig. 17). Both of these truncated proteins lack either HKIDAG (in case of GAME36-like-1) or DFGWG (in case of GAME36-like-2) motifs in their sequences. In wild tomato S. pennellii, we noticed the presence of GAME36 and full-length GAME36-like homolog (67% homology at amino acid level) on chromosome 8 within ~13 Kbp genomic region (Supplementary Fig. 17). Notably, recombinant S. pennellii GAME36-like protein did not exhibit acyltransferase activity when tested with hydroxytomatine or hydroxysolamargine substrates. The GAME36-like proteins from cultivated and wild tomato are located next to GAME36 clade in the phylogeny."

			"justification": "The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine.",
			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

The control reaction (shown in black) was performed with hydroxytomatine using extracts from E. coli cells transformed with an empty pET28 vector. The recombinant GAME36 enzyme produces the same acetoxytomatine peak as typically observed in green fruit extracts of tomato (in blue).

Source data are provided as a Source Data file. m/z, mass to charge. E. coli, Escherichia coli.\nFollowing our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"justification": "GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine",
			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

On the contrary, ripening-impaired mutants such as ripening-inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor) and Never-ripe (Nr) showed reduced levels of Esculeoside A, but accumulated its pathway intermediates (e.g., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine) compared to wild type fruit. These results in the tomato mutant lines suggest that the late steps in Esculeoside A pathway depend on ethylene during ripening. In fact, GAME40 (also known as E8) catalyzing the penultimate step in Esculeoside A pathway is a known ethylene-responsive gene during fruit ripening and regulated by ethylene and several other transcription factors involved in fruit ripening. Moreover, the expression of GAME5 transcript (associated with last step in Esculeoside A pathway) was severely affected in ripening mutants compared to wild type fruit, where it is highly upregulated at the breaker stage (Supplementary Fig. 20). The earlier steps in the Esculeoside A pathway carried out by GAME31 and GAME36 appear to be ethylene-independent as expression of these genes was not affected in ripening impaired tomato mutants. This ripening associated chemical shift in SGAs metabolism was likely selected during tomato fruit domestication and breeding to prevent the accumulation of alpha-tomatine in ripe fruit that results in bitter flavor. Evolutionary wise, reducing the toxicity of fruit could facilitate feeding by frugivores and consequently promote seed dispersal."

Discovery of the GAME36 acyltransferase not merely completes the biosynthetic pathway of non-bitter and less toxic SGAs (e.g., Esculeoside A) in tomato fruit, but also allows the in vivo and in vitro reconstitution of the entire metabolic pathway from alpha-tomatine up to Esculeoside A. Our results expand the understanding of the ripening-associated metabolic shift in SGA composition assuring non-bitter forms of ripe tomato fruits as consumed at present."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

This dataset was obtained from tomato (cv. Micro Tom) skin and flesh tissues of five fruit developmental stages (immature green, mature green, orange, breaker and red ripe) and various other tissues (young leaf, flower buds, young flower petals and roots). The selected BAHD candidate genes included those that were preferentially expressed in the immature and mature green stages of fruit development versus the red ripe stage [skin and/or flesh with fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) >= 15)]. Additional filtering by transcript expression level in flower buds' tissue (FPKM >= 10) that typically accumulate acetoxytomatine reduced this list to 11 BAHD candidates for further functional characterization (Supplementary Fig. 4). To test their role in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we cloned each BAHD candidate from the cultivated tomato and expressed it separately in E. coli cells. Purified proteins were then assayed for in vitro acyltransferase activity with hydroxytomatine as a substrate (isolated from transgenic tomato plants overexpressing the GAME31 gene). Analysis of assay mixtures using a short LC-MS method (15 min. per sample) revealed that one candidate (Solyc08g075210) generated an acetylated compound that is acetoxytomatine (m/z 1092.54; C52H85NO23) when incubated with hydroxytomatine (m/z 1050.50; C50H83NO22) and acetyl-CoA as acyl donor (Fig. 2b). The acetoxytomatine peak observed here was identical to the one detected in the green fruit extracts of cultivated tomato (Fig. 2b). Thus, in vitro enzyme assays confirmed that candidate Solyc08g075210, named here GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM36 (GAME36), can catalyze the biosynthesis of acetoxytomatine."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "alpha-tomatine, a renowned toxic and bitter-tasting compound is the major SGA that accumulates predominantly in leaves and green fruit of tomato. To prevent the self-toxicity effect, alpha-tomatine is transported and stored in the vacuole by an unknown transporter after its biosynthesis. During the transition from green to red fruit, the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is metabolized to the non-bitter and less toxic Esculeoside A in the cytosolic compartment via a suite of hydroxylation, acetylation, and glycosylation reactions (Fig. 1, and refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for detailed SGA pathway). GORKY, a nitrate/peptide family transporter facilitates this metabolic shift by exporting alpha-tomatine from vacuoles to cytosol during tomato fruit ripening. The relocation of alpha-tomatine back to the cytosol is important where it is available for further enzymatic conversions to form Esculeoside A, the dominant SGA in red, ripe tomato fruit. Thus, the major change in SGA composition in the course of fruit ripening is the accumulation of Esculeoside A in the red ripe stage at the expense of alpha-tomatine. Notably, the ripening associated metabolic shift from defense-associated alkaloids (e.g., alpha-tomatine) to Esculeoside A appears to be ethylene-dependent in later stages of fruit development. Moreover, this reduction in bitterness and toxicity in ripe tomato fruit increases palatability for consumption and favors seed dispersal. Earlier studies suggested that catabolism of the bitter alpha-tomatine during fruit ripening occurs in the following four steps: (i) C-23 hydroxylation of alpha-tomatine to hydroxytomatine, followed by (ii) 23-O-acetylation of hydroxytomatine to form acetoxytomatine; (iii) conversion of acetoxytomatine to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via C-27 hydroxylation, (iv) which is then converted to Esculeoside A through 27-O-glucosylation (Fig. 1). We recently reported the tomato GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM31 (GAME31), GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes catalyzing the first C-23 hydroxylation, penultimate C-27 hydroxylation and last 27-O-glucosylation steps in Esculeoside A biosynthesis, respectively (Fig. 1). However, the biosynthetic enzyme involved in the conversion of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine remains to be identified in any cultivated and wild tomato species."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"justification": "The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine.",
			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

This dataset was obtained from tomato (cv. Micro Tom) skin and flesh tissues of five fruit developmental stages (immature green, mature green, orange, breaker and red ripe) and various other tissues (young leaf, flower buds, young flower petals and roots). The selected BAHD candidate genes included those that were preferentially expressed in the immature and mature green stages of fruit development versus the red ripe stage [skin and/or flesh with fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) >= 15)]. Additional filtering by transcript expression level in flower buds' tissue (FPKM >= 10) that typically accumulate acetoxytomatine reduced this list to 11 BAHD candidates for further functional characterization (Supplementary Fig. 4). To test their role in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we cloned each BAHD candidate from the cultivated tomato and expressed it separately in E. coli cells. Purified proteins were then assayed for in vitro acyltransferase activity with hydroxytomatine as a substrate (isolated from transgenic tomato plants overexpressing the GAME31 gene). Analysis of assay mixtures using a short LC-MS method (15 min. per sample) revealed that one candidate (Solyc08g075210) generated an acetylated compound that is acetoxytomatine (m/z 1092.54; C52H85NO23) when incubated with hydroxytomatine (m/z 1050.50; C50H83NO22) and acetyl-CoA as acyl donor (Fig. 2b). The acetoxytomatine peak observed here was identical to the one detected in the green fruit extracts of cultivated tomato (Fig. 2b). Thus, in vitro enzyme assays confirmed that candidate Solyc08g075210, named here GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM36 (GAME36), can catalyze the biosynthesis of acetoxytomatine."

			"context": "We explored the genetic variation in GAME36 by extracting the coding sequences from cultivated tomato and related wild accessions (from Sol Genomics Network server), representative of tomato clade in the genus Solanum. We noted the presence of the GAME36 gene in all the selected accessions (Fig. 7a). However, in two wild accessions, S. huaylasense LA1983 and S. peruvianum LA1278, we noticed two nonsense SNPs in GAME36 (one in each accession) that introduced premature stop codons, therefore likely producing truncated, non-functional GAME36 variant proteins (Supplementary Fig. 16a). We next amplified and sequenced the GAME36 coding region from several wild tomato accessions and examined the completeness of sequences. Notably, we could only confirm the nonsense mutation in S. huaylasense LA1983, but not in S. peruvianum LA1278 (Supplementary Fig. 16b & 16c) as predicted. Thus, the nonsense SNP originally identified for GAME36 in S. peruvianum LA1278 was a sequencing discrepancy, which remained unverified by further analysis in the genome of S. peruvianum LA1278 accession. The other wild accessions including S. peruvianum LA1278 displayed full-length GAME36 sequences, encoding further full-length GAME36 proteins (Fig. 7a). We further analyzed acetoxytomatine and hydroxytomatine content in leaves of these selected wild tomato accessions. Cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum cv. Moneymaker) accumulate these SGAs in its leaves and possess functional GAME36 protein, thus was included in genomic and metabolite analysis as positive control. While acetoxytomatine was detected in almost all wild tomato species, we could not find it in S. huaylasense LA1983 accession (Fig. 7b). Furthermore, very high levels of hydroxytomatine (precursor of acetoxytomatine) were observed in S. huaylasense LA1983 accession compared to other wild species (Fig. 7c). These results suggest that the non-functional GAME36 enzyme in S. huaylasense LA1983 prevents the formation of acetoxytomatine in this accession.\na GAME36 genotype variants obtained from cultivated and wild tomato species. '+' (plus) sign indicates presence of genotype (e.g. coding sequence and/or full-length protein) in a particular tomato species. Red square with '-' (negative) sign marks the absence of full-length GAME36 proteins in the S. huaylasense LA1983 and S. peruvianum LA1278 accessions. The predicted GAME36 genotypes were further confirmed and compared by Sanger sequencing of cloned GAME36 sequences from respective wild tomato species. b, c LC-MS based profiling of acetoxytomatine (b) and hydroxytomatine (c) in leaves of cultivated and wild tomato accessions.

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"justification": "The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum.",
			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

The recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was able to utilize hydroxytomatine (GAME31 assay product) and all aliphatic acyl donors (except malonyl CoA) tested to generate corresponding acylated SGA metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, SlGAME36 did not show any acyltransferase activity when aromatic CoA thioesters were used as acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 7). We further set up an additional experiment in which recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was incubated with hydroxytomatine (acceptor substrate) and mixture of five acyl CoAs (0.2 mM each CoA; acetyl-, butyryl-, isovaleryl-, hexanoyl- and octanoyl-) in a single tube. The acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA were efficiently used as acyl donor with hydroxytomatine, and formed over 93% acylated SGAs together compared to all acylated SGA metabolites generated in the enzyme assay (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In case of hydroxysolamargine as a substrate, we also noted the dominance of acetylated- and butyrylated- SGAs as assay products, suggesting the preference of SlGAME36 enzyme for acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA compared to other acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 8b). We also examined whether GAME36 could catalyze freely reversible reaction, as reported previously for several other BAHD enzymes. Interestingly, GAME36 enzyme did not catalyze reversible reaction when incubated with acetoxytomatine (typical assay product) and CoA as substrates (Supplementary Fig. 9). In addition, we did not observe any spontaneous formation of hydroxytomatine when acetoxytomatine was incubated with CoA, but without GAME36 enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 9)."

These GAME proteins belong to three different enzyme families namely, 2-Oxoglutarate-Dependent Dioxygenases [2-ODDs; i.e., GAME31 and GAME40), BAHD acyltransferases (GAME36) and Uridine diphosphate (UDP) glycosyltransferases (UGTs: GAME5). We next asked whether the four recombinant GAME enzymes could metabolize alpha-tomatine to produce Esculeoside A. We reconstructed the Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway by adding the four purified enzymes expressed in E. Coli (i.e., GAME31, GAME36, GAME40, and GAME5), alpha-tomatine and the appropriate co-factors (alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, Fe2+, acetyl-CoA and UDP-glucose) in a single tube. We noted that this reaction produced not only the final product, Esculeoside A but also all pathway intermediates (hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) (Fig. 6) that accumulate in vivo in numerous cultivated and wild tomato species. As the order of reactions of the Esculeoside A pathway is confirmed here as proposed previously, stepwise reconstitution experiments were performed by sequentially adding the respective GAME enzymes, alpha-tomatine, and relevant co-factors in a single tube. Sequential assays produced explicitly the expected pathway intermediates (e.g., hydroxytomatine) associated with Esculeoside A pathway (Fig. 6)."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

			"context": "The ripening-associated changes in SGA metabolism (conversion of alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A) are controlled by the ripening-inducing phytohormone ethylene, and exogenous ethylene treatments of tomato fruit accelerated this chemical shift (higher Esculeoside A and lower alpha-tomatine). On the contrary, ripening-impaired mutants such as ripening-inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor) and Never-ripe (Nr) showed reduced levels of Esculeoside A, but accumulated its pathway intermediates (e.g., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine) compared to wild type fruit. These results in the tomato mutant lines suggest that the late steps in Esculeoside A pathway depend on ethylene during ripening. In fact, GAME40 (also known as E8) catalyzing the penultimate step in Esculeoside A pathway is a known ethylene-responsive gene during fruit ripening and regulated by ethylene and several other transcription factors involved in fruit ripening. Moreover, the expression of GAME5 transcript (associated with last step in Esculeoside A pathway) was severely affected in ripening mutants compared to wild type fruit, where it is highly upregulated at the breaker stage (Supplementary Fig. 20). The earlier steps in the Esculeoside A pathway carried out by GAME31 and GAME36 appear to be ethylene-independent as expression of these genes was not affected in ripening impaired tomato mutants. This ripening associated chemical shift in SGAs metabolism was likely selected during tomato fruit domestication and breeding to prevent the accumulation of alpha-tomatine in ripe fruit that results in bitter flavor. Evolutionary wise, reducing the toxicity of fruit could facilitate feeding by frugivores and consequently promote seed dispersal."

			"context": "During tomato fruit ripening (from green up to the red ripe stage), alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine are converted to Esculeoside A and dehydro-esculeoside A, respectively. To investigate the impact of GAME36 activity on ripening-associated SGA metabolism, we compared the SGA profile of wild type and game36 tomato fruits. Analysis of green fruit from game36 mutant lines showed dramatic accumulation of hydroxytomatine and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine compared with wild-type green fruit (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, no major change in alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine levels was observed in green fruit of the game36 mutant lines. In contrast, we did not detect acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine, the latter SGA derived from acetoxytomatine through additional hydroxylation, in game36 green fruit (Fig. 5b, refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for SGA pathway). Thus, reduced GAME36 activity in the green fruit resulted in the complete loss of acetoxy-SGAs with concomitant buildup of its precursor SGAs. In red, ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines, we detected massive accumulation of hydroxytomatine, hydroxytomatine isomer, and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine SGAs in comparison to wild-type fruit at the same stage (Fig. 5c). In fact, these precursor SGAs were the predominant SGAs in red fruit of the game36 mutant tomato plants. In parallel, SGAs produced downstream of hydroxytomatine (i.e., acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) towards Esculeoside A were not detected in ripe game36 fruit (apart from mutant line #50 that showed negligible levels). Yet, we observed minimal levels of Esculeoside A in red ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, we detected a substantial decrease in di-hydroxytomatine SGA (a likely derivative of hydroxytomatine) in comparison to wild type ripe fruit (Fig. 5d). Altogether, our in vivo and in vitro results confirmed that tomato GAME36 catalyzes the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine in the Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway."

We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3).\nStarting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates.

			"context": "During tomato fruit ripening (from green up to the red ripe stage), alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine are converted to Esculeoside A and dehydro-esculeoside A, respectively. To investigate the impact of GAME36 activity on ripening-associated SGA metabolism, we compared the SGA profile of wild type and game36 tomato fruits. Analysis of green fruit from game36 mutant lines showed dramatic accumulation of hydroxytomatine and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine compared with wild-type green fruit (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, no major change in alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine levels was observed in green fruit of the game36 mutant lines. In contrast, we did not detect acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine, the latter SGA derived from acetoxytomatine through additional hydroxylation, in game36 green fruit (Fig. 5b, refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for SGA pathway). Thus, reduced GAME36 activity in the green fruit resulted in the complete loss of acetoxy-SGAs with concomitant buildup of its precursor SGAs. In red, ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines, we detected massive accumulation of hydroxytomatine, hydroxytomatine isomer, and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine SGAs in comparison to wild-type fruit at the same stage (Fig. 5c). In fact, these precursor SGAs were the predominant SGAs in red fruit of the game36 mutant tomato plants. In parallel, SGAs produced downstream of hydroxytomatine (i.e., acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) towards Esculeoside A were not detected in ripe game36 fruit (apart from mutant line #50 that showed negligible levels). Yet, we observed minimal levels of Esculeoside A in red ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, we detected a substantial decrease in di-hydroxytomatine SGA (a likely derivative of hydroxytomatine) in comparison to wild type ripe fruit (Fig. 5d). Altogether, our in vivo and in vitro results confirmed that tomato GAME36 catalyzes the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine in the Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work.\nFollowing our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

To investigate the impact of GAME36 activity on ripening-associated SGA metabolism, we compared the SGA profile of wild type and game36 tomato fruits. Analysis of green fruit from game36 mutant lines showed dramatic accumulation of hydroxytomatine and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine compared with wild-type green fruit (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, no major change in alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine levels was observed in green fruit of the game36 mutant lines. In contrast, we did not detect acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine, the latter SGA derived from acetoxytomatine through additional hydroxylation, in game36 green fruit (Fig. 5b, refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for SGA pathway). Thus, reduced GAME36 activity in the green fruit resulted in the complete loss of acetoxy-SGAs with concomitant buildup of its precursor SGAs. In red, ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines, we detected massive accumulation of hydroxytomatine, hydroxytomatine isomer, and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine SGAs in comparison to wild-type fruit at the same stage (Fig. 5c). In fact, these precursor SGAs were the predominant SGAs in red fruit of the game36 mutant tomato plants. In parallel, SGAs produced downstream of hydroxytomatine (i.e., acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) towards Esculeoside A were not detected in ripe game36 fruit (apart from mutant line #50 that showed negligible levels). Yet, we observed minimal levels of Esculeoside A in red ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, we detected a substantial decrease in di-hydroxytomatine SGA (a likely derivative of hydroxytomatine) in comparison to wild type ripe fruit (Fig. 5d). Altogether, our in vivo and in vitro results confirmed that tomato GAME36 catalyzes the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine in the Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

			"context": "Starting from alpha-tomatine at early fruit development, the biosynthesis of Esculeoside A requires four enzymatic steps (Fig. 1). Having recently uncovered the GAME31, GAME40 and GAME5 enzymes that produce hydroxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A respectively the only missing step remaining to be discovered in the Esculeoside A pathway was the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine (Fig. 1). We envisaged that as for acetoxytomatine, a similar acetylation step and corresponding enzyme might be required to form acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, a dehydro-derivative of acetoxytomatine from hydroxy-dehydrotomatine (Supplementary Fig. 1 for a detailed tomato SGA pathway). A BAHD acyltransferase family protein could possibly catalyze these acetylation steps, as members of this family carry out acylation of diverse substrates in plant specialized metabolic pathways. To identify a putative BAHD acyltransferase associated with acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we searched for BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates co-expressed with known Esculeoside A pathway genes (i.e., GAME31, GAME40, and GAME5) using various tomato transcriptome datasets. Unfortunately, this approach failed to provide any potential BAHD candidates for functional characterization. This could be due to differential regulation of the SGA pathway genes during fruit ripening. Earlier steps of this pathway up to acetoxytomatine (catalyzed by GAME31 and a yet unknown acyltransferase) are predicted to occur in green stage of fruit development in ethylene-independent manner. Further downstream steps towards Esculeoside A performed by GAME40 and GAME5 are ethylene-dependent and importantly, occur in later stages of fruit development (e.g., orange and red ripe stages). We then tested whether two communal germplasm resources [i.e., Introgression lines (ILs) and Backcross inbred lines (BILs)] derived from crosses between cultivated (S. lycopersicum cv. M82) and wild (S. pennellii LA0716) tomato species could facilitate BAHD acyltransferase gene discovery via a 'forward' genetic screening. We had previously investigated ILs and BILs tomato populations to map the Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with SGA biosynthesis in tomato. These approaches proved to be effective as we discovered two key enzymes (GAME31 and GAME5) involved in the Esculeoside A pathway. In the context of this study, we next looked for narrow genomic regions associated with acetoxytomatine content in the ILs and BILs. Although we found two QTLs associated with an increase (on chromosome 2) and a decrease (on chromosome 4) in acetoxytomatine levels, the corresponding mapped genomic regions did not contain any putative BAHD acyltransferase gene candidates. As an alternative, we implemented a more comprehensive functional genomics approach and searched for all putative BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato genome. We revealed 100 coding sequences annotated as putative BAHD acyltransferase in the tomato genome (ITAG v2.4) (Supplementary Data 1). However, after excluding the BAHDs with well-characterized functions, the list of candidate BAHDs involved in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis could not be narrowed down further based on the sequence. At this point, we reasoned that comparative profiling of acetoxytomatine in different tomato tissues, coupled with transcript expression profiles of BAHDs obtained from the same tissues could aid in prioritizing a reasonable number of candidate genes for further work."

However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature.

To investigate the impact of GAME36 activity on ripening-associated SGA metabolism, we compared the SGA profile of wild type and game36 tomato fruits. Analysis of green fruit from game36 mutant lines showed dramatic accumulation of hydroxytomatine and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine compared with wild-type green fruit (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, no major change in alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine levels was observed in green fruit of the game36 mutant lines. In contrast, we did not detect acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine, the latter SGA derived from acetoxytomatine through additional hydroxylation, in game36 green fruit (Fig. 5b, refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for SGA pathway). Thus, reduced GAME36 activity in the green fruit resulted in the complete loss of acetoxy-SGAs with concomitant buildup of its precursor SGAs. In red, ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines, we detected massive accumulation of hydroxytomatine, hydroxytomatine isomer, and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine SGAs in comparison to wild-type fruit at the same stage (Fig. 5c). In fact, these precursor SGAs were the predominant SGAs in red fruit of the game36 mutant tomato plants. In parallel, SGAs produced downstream of hydroxytomatine (i.e., acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) towards Esculeoside A were not detected in ripe game36 fruit (apart from mutant line #50 that showed negligible levels). Yet, we observed minimal levels of Esculeoside A in red ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, we detected a substantial decrease in di-hydroxytomatine SGA (a likely derivative of hydroxytomatine) in comparison to wild type ripe fruit (Fig. 5d). Altogether, our in vivo and in vitro results confirmed that tomato GAME36 catalyzes the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine in the Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway."

However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively.

As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36.

The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs.

			"justification": "the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine... from dehydrotomatine",
			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

Moreover, both leaves and flowers of the game36 mutant lines showed a major increase in hydroxytomatine isomers that are typically present in minor levels in these tissues (Supplementary Fig. 14)."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3).\na Profiling of acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine in different tissue types of cultivated tomato (S. lycopersicum cv.

The control reaction (shown in black) was performed with hydroxytomatine using extracts from E. coli cells transformed with an empty pET28 vector. The recombinant GAME36 enzyme produces the same acetoxytomatine peak as typically observed in green fruit extracts of tomato (in blue).

			"context": "Directed by the metabolic profiling results, we selected 16 candidate proteins of the BAHD class (excluding the ones characterized earlier) from our in-house generated tomato transcriptome dataset (NCBI SRA: PRJNA307656). This dataset was obtained from tomato (cv. Micro Tom) skin and flesh tissues of five fruit developmental stages (immature green, mature green, orange, breaker and red ripe) and various other tissues (young leaf, flower buds, young flower petals and roots). The selected BAHD candidate genes included those that were preferentially expressed in the immature and mature green stages of fruit development versus the red ripe stage [skin and/or flesh with fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) >= 15)]. Additional filtering by transcript expression level in flower buds' tissue (FPKM >= 10) that typically accumulate acetoxytomatine reduced this list to 11 BAHD candidates for further functional characterization (Supplementary Fig. 4). To test their role in acetoxytomatine biosynthesis, we cloned each BAHD candidate from the cultivated tomato and expressed it separately in E. coli cells. Purified proteins were then assayed for in vitro acyltransferase activity with hydroxytomatine as a substrate (isolated from transgenic tomato plants overexpressing the GAME31 gene). Analysis of assay mixtures using a short LC-MS method (15 min. per sample) revealed that one candidate (Solyc08g075210) generated an acetylated compound that is acetoxytomatine (m/z 1092.54; C52H85NO23) when incubated with hydroxytomatine (m/z 1050.50; C50H83NO22) and acetyl-CoA as acyl donor (Fig. 2b). The acetoxytomatine peak observed here was identical to the one detected in the green fruit extracts of cultivated tomato (Fig. 2b). Thus, in vitro enzyme assays confirmed that candidate Solyc08g075210, named here GLYCOALKALOID METABOLISM36 (GAME36), can catalyze the biosynthesis of acetoxytomatine."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

Moreover, there is no GAME36-like homolog present in the cultivated potato and eggplant genome (Supplementary Fig. 17). The presence or absence of GAME36-like genes is evident both in homology searches as well as in comparisons of syntenic regions between cultivated tomato, cultivated eggplant, and wild S. pennellii (Supplementary Fig. 18). In tomato, apparently very few (11 out of the 100 BAHDs) have been experimentally characterized. ASAT1 to ASAT4 proteins involved in acyl sugar biosynthesis form separate clades based on their role in the acylation of different sugar and acyl-CoA substrates (Fig. 8). DCR, AAT1, and FdAT1 proteins involved in cutin and wax metabolism, volatile biosynthesis and anthocyanin decoration respectively form distinct sub-clades. Four BAHD proteins (ACT, HCT, SHT, and HQT) proteins participating in the acylation of primary alcohol/amines and anthocyanins are also clearly separated from the rest of the BAHD proteins (Fig. 8). Thus, the versatile roles displayed by tomato BAHD proteins including GAME36 are reflected in the phylogenetic analysis, which suggests that the evolution of BAHD family members drive the expansion of metabolic diversification in tomato."

The presence or absence of GAME36-like genes is evident both in homology searches as well as in comparisons of syntenic regions between cultivated tomato, cultivated eggplant, and wild S. pennellii (Supplementary Fig. 18). In tomato, apparently very few (11 out of the 100 BAHDs) have been experimentally characterized. ASAT1 to ASAT4 proteins involved in acyl sugar biosynthesis form separate clades based on their role in the acylation of different sugar and acyl-CoA substrates (Fig. 8). DCR, AAT1, and FdAT1 proteins involved in cutin and wax metabolism, volatile biosynthesis and anthocyanin decoration respectively form distinct sub-clades. Four BAHD proteins (ACT, HCT, SHT, and HQT) proteins participating in the acylation of primary alcohol/amines and anthocyanins are also clearly separated from the rest of the BAHD proteins (Fig. 8). Thus, the versatile roles displayed by tomato BAHD proteins including GAME36 are reflected in the phylogenetic analysis, which suggests that the evolution of BAHD family members drive the expansion of metabolic diversification in tomato.\nFollowing our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

Coli (i.e., GAME31, GAME36, GAME40, and GAME5), alpha-tomatine and the appropriate co-factors (alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, Fe2+, acetyl-CoA and UDP-glucose) in a single tube. We noted that this reaction produced not only the final product, Esculeoside A but also all pathway intermediates (hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) (Fig. 6) that accumulate in vivo in numerous cultivated and wild tomato species. As the order of reactions of the Esculeoside A pathway is confirmed here as proposed previously, stepwise reconstitution experiments were performed by sequentially adding the respective GAME enzymes, alpha-tomatine, and relevant co-factors in a single tube. Sequential assays produced explicitly the expected pathway intermediates (e.g., hydroxytomatine) associated with Esculeoside A pathway (Fig. 6)."

We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature.

On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

We noted that this reaction produced not only the final product, Esculeoside A but also all pathway intermediates (hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) (Fig. 6) that accumulate in vivo in numerous cultivated and wild tomato species. As the order of reactions of the Esculeoside A pathway is confirmed here as proposed previously, stepwise reconstitution experiments were performed by sequentially adding the respective GAME enzymes, alpha-tomatine, and relevant co-factors in a single tube. Sequential assays produced explicitly the expected pathway intermediates (e.g., hydroxytomatine) associated with Esculeoside A pathway (Fig. 6)."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown).

We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs.

Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature.

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives.

However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

Several studies reported multiple therapeutic applications of Esculeoside A in human health. For example, Fujiwara et al. isolated Esculeoside A from ripe tomato fruits, and showed its potent cytotoxic activity against MCF7 (human breast cancer cell) and B16F2F (mouse melanoma cell) cells. The GI50 values of Esculeoside A were reported to be 13.3 and 7.9 microM against MCF7 and B16F2F, respectively. Moreover, Yang et al. proposed a possible application of Esculeoside A as a functional supplement for diabetes treatment using mice model. Another study by Zhou et al. showed the role of Esculeoside A in ameliorating atopic dermatitis in mice (IC50 9 microM) via blocking hyaluronidase activity in vitro and in vivo."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown).

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

These proteins formed a distinct clade, supporting the unique divergent function of this BAHD in SGA biosynthesis. Interestingly, we detected three clustered BAHD acyltransferase genes in the cultivated tomato chromosome 8 spanning ~13 Kbp region that includes a single GAME36 and two truncated GAME36-like homologs (Supplementary Fig. 17). Both of these truncated proteins lack either HKIDAG (in case of GAME36-like-1) or DFGWG (in case of GAME36-like-2) motifs in their sequences. In wild tomato S. pennellii, we noticed the presence of GAME36 and full-length GAME36-like homolog (67% homology at amino acid level) on chromosome 8 within ~13 Kbp genomic region (Supplementary Fig. 17). Notably, recombinant S. pennellii GAME36-like protein did not exhibit acyltransferase activity when tested with hydroxytomatine or hydroxysolamargine substrates. The GAME36-like proteins from cultivated and wild tomato are located next to GAME36 clade in the phylogeny."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"justification": "GAME36 generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine",
			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature.

			"context": "Following our finding that the cultivated tomato GAME36 (SlGAME36) generates acetoxytomatine in vitro via acetylation of hydroxytomatine, we sought to assess whether this enzyme can also act on different hydroxylated SGA substrates that are typically found in tomato (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine) and eggplant (e.g., hydroxysolamargine) and form the corresponding acetoxy-SGA derivatives. However, since these hydroxylated SGAs are produced at relatively low levels in tomato or eggplant, their isolation for in vitro assays is highly inefficient. To address this issue, we used the previously reported GAME31 enzyme from tomato (SlGAME31) that hydroxylates core SGAs including alpha-tomatine, dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine to produce hydroxytomatine, hydroxy-dehydrotomatine, hydroxytomatidine and hydroxysolamargine, respectively. We next performed in vitro coupled enzyme assays using the purified SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 proteins with different SGAs as substrates. Incubation of both recombinant enzymes with alpha-tomatine, acetyl-coA, alpha-ketoglutarate, ascorbate, and Fe2+ generated the expected product, acetoxytomatine (Fig. 2c, in blue). Moreover, the combination of SlGAME31 and SlGAME36 enzymes also generated acetoxy-dehydrotomatine (Fig. 2d, in blue), acetoxytomatidine (Supplementary Fig. 5, in blue) and acetoxysolamargine (Supplementary Fig. 6, in blue) from dehydrotomatine, tomatidine and alpha-solamargine, respectively. As previously reported, assays containing SlGAME31 and any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., dehydrotomatine) only produced their corresponding hydroxylated products (e.g., hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in red). On the other hand, when examined alone, the recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme did not exhibit acyltransferase activity with any of the core SGA substrates (e.g., alpha-tomatine) (Fig. 2c, d and, Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6; in dark purple) suggesting its strict substrate preference towards hydroxylated SGAs. Through a sequence similarity search, we identified a clear ortholog of GAME36 in wild tomato S. pennellii LA0716 (SpGAME36; Sopen08g023820), encoding a protein that shares 99% amino acid identity with SlGAME36. The recombinant SpGAME36 protein expressed in E. coli tested together with SlGAME31 enzyme and required co-factors also converted alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine to acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, respectively (Fig. 2c and d; in tan, brown). Moreover, recombinant SlGAME31 and SpGAME36 enzymes generated acetoxytomatidine and acetoxysolamargine when assayed using tomatidine and alpha-solamargine substrates, respectively (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6, in tan brown). We also examined the activity of the recombinant SmGAME36 (from cultivated eggplant; 60% amino acid identity with SlGAME36) in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using a similar set of SGA substrates. The recombinant SmGAME36 enzyme did not metabolize hydroxylated SGAs (SlGAME31 assay products) to generate the corresponding acetylated SGA derivatives. The formation of acetylated SGAs by both SlGAME36 (cultivated tomato) and SpGAME36 (wild tomato) proteins suggested that GAME36 has a conserved function in the tomato branch of genus Solanum. Altogether, these results showed that GAME36 is capable of catalyzing in vitro acetylation specifically on various hydroxylated SGAs. Acetylated metabolites (enzyme assay products) were putatively identified by comparing their retention times, accurate mass-derived elemental composition, and mass fragmentation pattern with those described for the same in the literature. An additional MS/MS analysis was performed to analyze the structures of acetylated compounds (Supplementary Data 3)."

			"context": "To examine the prospect of substrate promiscuity, we next tested the activity of SlGAME36 with various aliphatic (acetyl CoA, malonyl CoA, butyryl CoA, isovalyryl CoA, hexanoyl CoA, octanoyl CoA) and aromatic (coumaroyl CoA and cinnamoyl CoA) acyl donors in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using alpha-tomatine as a substrate. The recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was able to utilize hydroxytomatine (GAME31 assay product) and all aliphatic acyl donors (except malonyl CoA) tested to generate corresponding acylated SGA metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, SlGAME36 did not show any acyltransferase activity when aromatic CoA thioesters were used as acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 7). We further set up an additional experiment in which recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was incubated with hydroxytomatine (acceptor substrate) and mixture of five acyl CoAs (0.2 mM each CoA; acetyl-, butyryl-, isovaleryl-, hexanoyl- and octanoyl-) in a single tube. The acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA were efficiently used as acyl donor with hydroxytomatine, and formed over 93% acylated SGAs together compared to all acylated SGA metabolites generated in the enzyme assay (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In case of hydroxysolamargine as a substrate, we also noted the dominance of acetylated- and butyrylated- SGAs as assay products, suggesting the preference of SlGAME36 enzyme for acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA compared to other acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 8b). We also examined whether GAME36 could catalyze freely reversible reaction, as reported previously for several other BAHD enzymes. Interestingly, GAME36 enzyme did not catalyze reversible reaction when incubated with acetoxytomatine (typical assay product) and CoA as substrates (Supplementary Fig. 9). In addition, we did not observe any spontaneous formation of hydroxytomatine when acetoxytomatine was incubated with CoA, but without GAME36 enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 9)."

			"context": "To study the kinetic properties of the SlGAME36 enzyme, we tested its affinity towards acyl donors (acetyl CoA, butyryl CoA) and acyl acceptors (hydroxytomatine and hydroxysolamargine). In vitro steady-state kinetics analysis suggested that SlGAME36 had a higher catalytic efficiency with hydroxytomatine (native substrate from tomato; kcat/Km = 250.52 min-1 muM-1) than hydroxysolamargine (SGA substrate from eggplant; kcat/Km = 41.22 min-1 muM-1) (Fig. 3a, b). In case of acyl donors, enzyme kinetic assays showed preferred specificity toward acetyl CoA over butyryl CoA (kcat/Km = 108.23 min-1 muM-1 for acetyl CoA compared with kcat/Km = 40.91 min-1 muM-1 for butyryl CoA) (Fig. 3c, d). Overall, our results demonstrated the promiscuity of the GAME36 enzyme in vitro by acylating hydroxy-SGAs using various aliphatic acyl CoA donors. Hydroxytomatine and hydroxysolamargine substrates used in the biochemical characterization of GAME36 were isolated from in vitro enzyme assays using GAME31 with either alpha-tomatine or alpha-solamargine, respectively (See Methods section for more details).\nTo examine the prospect of substrate promiscuity, we next tested the activity of SlGAME36 with various aliphatic (acetyl CoA, malonyl CoA, butyryl CoA, isovalyryl CoA, hexanoyl CoA, octanoyl CoA) and aromatic (coumaroyl CoA and cinnamoyl CoA) acyl donors in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using alpha-tomatine as a substrate. The recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was able to utilize hydroxytomatine (GAME31 assay product) and all aliphatic acyl donors (except malonyl CoA) tested to generate corresponding acylated SGA metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, SlGAME36 did not show any acyltransferase activity when aromatic CoA thioesters were used as acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 7). We further set up an additional experiment in which recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was incubated with hydroxytomatine (acceptor substrate) and mixture of five acyl CoAs (0.2 mM each CoA; acetyl-, butyryl-, isovaleryl-, hexanoyl- and octanoyl-) in a single tube. The acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA were efficiently used as acyl donor with hydroxytomatine, and formed over 93% acylated SGAs together compared to all acylated SGA metabolites generated in the enzyme assay (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In case of hydroxysolamargine as a substrate, we also noted the dominance of acetylated- and butyrylated- SGAs as assay products, suggesting the preference of SlGAME36 enzyme for acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA compared to other acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 8b). We also examined whether GAME36 could catalyze freely reversible reaction, as reported previously for several other BAHD enzymes. Interestingly, GAME36 enzyme did not catalyze reversible reaction when incubated with acetoxytomatine (typical assay product) and CoA as substrates (Supplementary Fig. 9). In addition, we did not observe any spontaneous formation of hydroxytomatine when acetoxytomatine was incubated with CoA, but without GAME36 enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 9)."

In case of acyl donors, enzyme kinetic assays showed preferred specificity toward acetyl CoA over butyryl CoA (kcat/Km = 108.23 min-1 muM-1 for acetyl CoA compared with kcat/Km = 40.91 min-1 muM-1 for butyryl CoA) (Fig. 3c, d). Overall, our results demonstrated the promiscuity of the GAME36 enzyme in vitro by acylating hydroxy-SGAs using various aliphatic acyl CoA donors. Hydroxytomatine and hydroxysolamargine substrates used in the biochemical characterization of GAME36 were isolated from in vitro enzyme assays using GAME31 with either alpha-tomatine or alpha-solamargine, respectively (See Methods section for more details)."

			"context": "To study the kinetic properties of the SlGAME36 enzyme, we tested its affinity towards acyl donors (acetyl CoA, butyryl CoA) and acyl acceptors (hydroxytomatine and hydroxysolamargine). In vitro steady-state kinetics analysis suggested that SlGAME36 had a higher catalytic efficiency with hydroxytomatine (native substrate from tomato; kcat/Km = 250.52 min-1 muM-1) than hydroxysolamargine (SGA substrate from eggplant; kcat/Km = 41.22 min-1 muM-1) (Fig. 3a, b). In case of acyl donors, enzyme kinetic assays showed preferred specificity toward acetyl CoA over butyryl CoA (kcat/Km = 108.23 min-1 muM-1 for acetyl CoA compared with kcat/Km = 40.91 min-1 muM-1 for butyryl CoA) (Fig. 3c, d). Overall, our results demonstrated the promiscuity of the GAME36 enzyme in vitro by acylating hydroxy-SGAs using various aliphatic acyl CoA donors. Hydroxytomatine and hydroxysolamargine substrates used in the biochemical characterization of GAME36 were isolated from in vitro enzyme assays using GAME31 with either alpha-tomatine or alpha-solamargine, respectively (See Methods section for more details).\nTo examine the prospect of substrate promiscuity, we next tested the activity of SlGAME36 with various aliphatic (acetyl CoA, malonyl CoA, butyryl CoA, isovalyryl CoA, hexanoyl CoA, octanoyl CoA) and aromatic (coumaroyl CoA and cinnamoyl CoA) acyl donors in coupled assays with SlGAME31 using alpha-tomatine as a substrate. The recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was able to utilize hydroxytomatine (GAME31 assay product) and all aliphatic acyl donors (except malonyl CoA) tested to generate corresponding acylated SGA metabolites (Supplementary Fig. 7). Notably, SlGAME36 did not show any acyltransferase activity when aromatic CoA thioesters were used as acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 7). We further set up an additional experiment in which recombinant SlGAME36 enzyme was incubated with hydroxytomatine (acceptor substrate) and mixture of five acyl CoAs (0.2 mM each CoA; acetyl-, butyryl-, isovaleryl-, hexanoyl- and octanoyl-) in a single tube. The acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA were efficiently used as acyl donor with hydroxytomatine, and formed over 93% acylated SGAs together compared to all acylated SGA metabolites generated in the enzyme assay (Supplementary Fig. 8a). In case of hydroxysolamargine as a substrate, we also noted the dominance of acetylated- and butyrylated- SGAs as assay products, suggesting the preference of SlGAME36 enzyme for acetyl CoA and butyryl CoA compared to other acyl donors (Supplementary Fig. 8b). We also examined whether GAME36 could catalyze freely reversible reaction, as reported previously for several other BAHD enzymes. Interestingly, GAME36 enzyme did not catalyze reversible reaction when incubated with acetoxytomatine (typical assay product) and CoA as substrates (Supplementary Fig. 9). In addition, we did not observe any spontaneous formation of hydroxytomatine when acetoxytomatine was incubated with CoA, but without GAME36 enzyme (Supplementary Fig. 9)."

In vitro steady-state kinetics analysis suggested that SlGAME36 had a higher catalytic efficiency with hydroxytomatine (native substrate from tomato; kcat/Km = 250.52 min-1 muM-1) than hydroxysolamargine (SGA substrate from eggplant; kcat/Km = 41.22 min-1 muM-1) (Fig. 3a, b). In case of acyl donors, enzyme kinetic assays showed preferred specificity toward acetyl CoA over butyryl CoA (kcat/Km = 108.23 min-1 muM-1 for acetyl CoA compared with kcat/Km = 40.91 min-1 muM-1 for butyryl CoA) (Fig. 3c, d). Overall, our results demonstrated the promiscuity of the GAME36 enzyme in vitro by acylating hydroxy-SGAs using various aliphatic acyl CoA donors. Hydroxytomatine and hydroxysolamargine substrates used in the biochemical characterization of GAME36 were isolated from in vitro enzyme assays using GAME31 with either alpha-tomatine or alpha-solamargine, respectively (See Methods section for more details)."

			"context": "Acetoxytomatine is one of the few SGAs commonly detected in almost every cultivated and wild tomato species. Yet, Iijima et al. (2013) reported the absence of acetoxytomatine and further downstream SGAs, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A in ripe fruit of the wild tomato S. neorickii (accession LA2133), but detected high levels of neorickiioside B (i.e., hydroxytomatine) in the same tissue. This suggested that biosynthesis of Esculeoside A from alpha-tomatine is inhibited at the acetylation step of hydroxytomatine in S. neorickii (LA2133). Here, we examined SGAs content in leaves and ripe fruit of S. neorickii (LA2133) and the cultivated tomato. Notably, very high levels of acetoxytomatine were observed in the leaves of S. neorickii compared to leaves of the cultivated tomato (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Moreover, we detected a set of SGAs associated with fruit ripening (i.e., hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A) in ripe fruit of S. neorickii (Supplementary Fig. 10b, c). The results indicate that Esculeoside A biosynthesis indeed takes place in S. neorickii (LA2133) fruit that likely contains the corresponding enzyme activities required for its biosynthesis. We next compared GAME36 expression levels in leaves of cultivated tomato and S. neorickii. GAME36 showed very weak expression in leaf tissue of cultivated tomato (Supplementary Fig. 10d) correlating with trace levels of acetoxytomatine in the leaves of this genotype (Supplementary Fig. 10a). S. neorickii displayed very high GAME36 expression as compared to the cultivated tomato leaves (Supplementary Fig. 10d) which explains the presence of very high acetoxytomatine levels in this accession (Supplementary Fig. 10a)."

Conversely, we observed significant accumulation of acetoxy-SGAs precursors (i.e., hydroxytomatine and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine) and additional upstream SGAs (i.e., alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine) in the flowers and leaves tissues compared to wild type ones (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 13). Moreover, both leaves and flowers of the game36 mutant lines showed a major increase in hydroxytomatine isomers that are typically present in minor levels in these tissues (Supplementary Fig. 14)."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction",
			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

To investigate the impact of GAME36 activity on ripening-associated SGA metabolism, we compared the SGA profile of wild type and game36 tomato fruits. Analysis of green fruit from game36 mutant lines showed dramatic accumulation of hydroxytomatine and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine compared with wild-type green fruit (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, no major change in alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine levels was observed in green fruit of the game36 mutant lines. In contrast, we did not detect acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine, the latter SGA derived from acetoxytomatine through additional hydroxylation, in game36 green fruit (Fig. 5b, refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for SGA pathway). Thus, reduced GAME36 activity in the green fruit resulted in the complete loss of acetoxy-SGAs with concomitant buildup of its precursor SGAs. In red, ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines, we detected massive accumulation of hydroxytomatine, hydroxytomatine isomer, and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine SGAs in comparison to wild-type fruit at the same stage (Fig. 5c). In fact, these precursor SGAs were the predominant SGAs in red fruit of the game36 mutant tomato plants. In parallel, SGAs produced downstream of hydroxytomatine (i.e., acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) towards Esculeoside A were not detected in ripe game36 fruit (apart from mutant line #50 that showed negligible levels). Yet, we observed minimal levels of Esculeoside A in red ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, we detected a substantial decrease in di-hydroxytomatine SGA (a likely derivative of hydroxytomatine) in comparison to wild type ripe fruit (Fig. 5d). Altogether, our in vivo and in vitro results confirmed that tomato GAME36 catalyzes the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine in the Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

To investigate the impact of GAME36 activity on ripening-associated SGA metabolism, we compared the SGA profile of wild type and game36 tomato fruits. Analysis of green fruit from game36 mutant lines showed dramatic accumulation of hydroxytomatine and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine compared with wild-type green fruit (Fig. 5a). Furthermore, no major change in alpha-tomatine and dehydrotomatine levels was observed in green fruit of the game36 mutant lines. In contrast, we did not detect acetoxy-dehydrotomatine, acetoxytomatine, and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine, the latter SGA derived from acetoxytomatine through additional hydroxylation, in game36 green fruit (Fig. 5b, refer Supplementary Fig. 1 for SGA pathway). Thus, reduced GAME36 activity in the green fruit resulted in the complete loss of acetoxy-SGAs with concomitant buildup of its precursor SGAs. In red, ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines, we detected massive accumulation of hydroxytomatine, hydroxytomatine isomer, and hydroxy-dehydrotomatine SGAs in comparison to wild-type fruit at the same stage (Fig. 5c). In fact, these precursor SGAs were the predominant SGAs in red fruit of the game36 mutant tomato plants. In parallel, SGAs produced downstream of hydroxytomatine (i.e., acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine) towards Esculeoside A were not detected in ripe game36 fruit (apart from mutant line #50 that showed negligible levels). Yet, we observed minimal levels of Esculeoside A in red ripe fruit of the game36 mutant lines (Fig. 5d). Furthermore, we detected a substantial decrease in di-hydroxytomatine SGA (a likely derivative of hydroxytomatine) in comparison to wild type ripe fruit (Fig. 5d). Altogether, our in vivo and in vitro results confirmed that tomato GAME36 catalyzes the acetylation of hydroxytomatine to acetoxytomatine in the Esculeoside A biosynthetic pathway."

ASAT1 to ASAT4 proteins involved in acyl sugar biosynthesis form separate clades based on their role in the acylation of different sugar and acyl-CoA substrates (Fig. 8). DCR, AAT1, and FdAT1 proteins involved in cutin and wax metabolism, volatile biosynthesis and anthocyanin decoration respectively form distinct sub-clades. Four BAHD proteins (ACT, HCT, SHT, and HQT) proteins participating in the acylation of primary alcohol/amines and anthocyanins are also clearly separated from the rest of the BAHD proteins (Fig. 8). Thus, the versatile roles displayed by tomato BAHD proteins including GAME36 are reflected in the phylogenetic analysis, which suggests that the evolution of BAHD family members drive the expansion of metabolic diversification in tomato."

ASAT1 to ASAT4 proteins involved in acyl sugar biosynthesis form separate clades based on their role in the acylation of different sugar and acyl-CoA substrates (Fig. 8). DCR, AAT1, and FdAT1 proteins involved in cutin and wax metabolism, volatile biosynthesis and anthocyanin decoration respectively form distinct sub-clades. Four BAHD proteins (ACT, HCT, SHT, and HQT) proteins participating in the acylation of primary alcohol/amines and anthocyanins are also clearly separated from the rest of the BAHD proteins (Fig. 8). Thus, the versatile roles displayed by tomato BAHD proteins including GAME36 are reflected in the phylogenetic analysis, which suggests that the evolution of BAHD family members drive the expansion of metabolic diversification in tomato."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted. This claim is further supported by reduced levels of di-hydroxytomatine in game36 mutant red fruits compared to wild-type ones, which could be due to channeling towards acetoxy-hydroxytomatine and Esculeoside A biosynthesis. We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

We believe that this minor pathway for Esculeoside A biosynthesis involving di-hydroxytomatine operates exclusively in late stages of fruit ripening like red ripe, and involves yet unknown ripening stage specific hydroxylase and acyltransferase enzymes to form di-hydroxytomatine and its downstream derivative, acetoxy-hydroxytomatine respectively (Supplementary Fig. 19)."

			"context": "The drop in bitter and toxic alpha-tomatine levels during tomato fruit maturation has been known for decades. Yet, only two reports by Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) proposed a putative metabolic pathway that converts alpha-tomatine to Esculeoside A. Prediction of the Esculeoside A pathway was based on metabolomics experiments obtained from fruit tissues at several developmental stages up to ripening. Both reports suggested that as fruit matures the entire pool of alpha-tomatine is converted through four core reactions to its hydroxylated, acylated, and glycosylated derivatives (e.g., Esculeoside A). The enzymes and order of reactions in the alpha-tomatine catabolic pathway were unknown at that time. Here we report the discovery of GAME36, an acyltransferase of the BAHD protein family that completes the identification of genes and enzymes predicted in the Mintz-Oron et al. (2008) and Iijima et al. (2013) pathway. Consequently, this allowed us to determine the order of reactions in the pathway to Esculeoside A. The main tomato SGA alpha-tomatine starts accumulating at fruit set reaching its maximum levels in mature green fruit. At this stage of development, the GAME31 dioxygenase hydroxylates alpha-tomatine at the C-23 position forming hydroxytomatine. GAME36, identified in this study next acetylates hydroxytomatine at the same position forming acetoxytomatine, which is then subjected for a second hydroxylation in the pathway (at position C-27) by GAME40, generating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine. The last step of the pathway is carried out by GAME5, glycosylating acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (at the 27-O position) to form Esculeoside A which accumulates to high levels in red, ripe fruit. Interestingly, unlike other reported BAHD enzymes (e.g., ASATs involved in acylsugar biosynthesis in tomato), GAME36 does not catalyze freely reversible reactions on pathway intermediates, thus ensuring these intermediates are available for further downstream GAME enzymes in the Esculeoside A pathway. Furthermore, in vivo characterization of GAME36 by knockout experiments revealed the possibility of an alternative, yet minor biosynthetic route to Esculeoside A in tomato fruit. Apart from the typical three intermediates (that is hydroxytomatine, acetoxytomatine and acetoxy-hydroxytomatine), previous studies proposed di-hydroxytomatine as an additional intermediate in the Esculeoside A pathway. Di-hydroxytomatine accumulates mainly in the late stages of tomato fruit ripening such as orange and red ripe fruits. This SGA was predicted to be synthesized from hydroxytomatine via additional hydroxylation, and further hypothesized to be converted to acetoxy-hydroxytomatine via acetylation reaction (Supplementary Fig. 19 for alternative Esculeoside A pathway). In this study, despite the complete absence of acetoxytomatine in green and red fruit of game36 mutant lines, we observed very low levels of Esculeoside A and its precursor acetoxy-hydroxytomatine (e.g., line#50 in Fig. 5D) in the mutant red fruits. This indicates that both these SGAs are formed in red fruit and specifically; there is an alternative route for acetoxy-hydroxytomatine biosynthesis likely from di-hydroxytomatine as predicted.

			"context": "Besides their role in defense in plants and anti-nutritional effects to humans, several SGAs from tomato (alpha-tomatine), potato (alpha-chaconine and alpha-solanine) and eggplant (alpha-solasonine and alpha-solamargine) are known for their anti-carcinogenic potential. Several studies reported multiple therapeutic applications of Esculeoside A in human health. For example, Fujiwara et al. isolated Esculeoside A from ripe tomato fruits, and showed its potent cytotoxic activity against MCF7 (human breast cancer cell) and B16F2F (mouse melanoma cell) cells. The GI50 values of Esculeoside A were reported to be 13.3 and 7.9 microM against MCF7 and B16F2F, respectively. Moreover, Yang et al. proposed a possible application of Esculeoside A as a functional supplement for diabetes treatment using mice model. Another study by Zhou et al. showed the role of Esculeoside A in ameliorating atopic dermatitis in mice (IC50 9 microM) via blocking hyaluronidase activity in vitro and in vivo."
