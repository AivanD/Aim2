			"context": "The enrichment of terpenoid and phenylpropanoid metabolism is consistent with prior studies illustrating ecotype-specific profiles of steroidal saponins and flavonoids (Li et al.,), and the upregulation, albeit at moderate levels, of switchgrass terpenoid- and phenylpropanoid-metabolic pathways in response to drought, UV irradiation and oxidative stress (Meyer et al.,; Pelot et al.,; Muchlinski et al.,; Tiedge et al.,). To investigate in more detail the impact of drought on switchgrass specialized metabolism, we compared the transcript abundance of key genes of the terpenoid and phenylpropanoid scaffold-forming pathways in both genotypes. Due to the lack of a Cave-in-Rock genome, gene annotations are based on homology searches against the switchgrass Alamo AP13 genome (phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Pvirgatum_v5_1). Interestingly, the focal genes showed similar tissue-specific expression profiles in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock and no substantial drought-induced gene expression changes were observed (Fig. 3). For example, of the four annotated 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) genes of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, two homologs, Pavir.3KG128241 and Pavir.3NG140939, were abundant in leaves but c. 10-60-fold less in roots of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3a). Likewise, the predicted squalene synthase, Pavir.4NG340500, displayed high abundance in leaves and low gene expression in roots. However, select genes showed genotype-specific differences in their expression patterns. This included the predicted geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), Pavir.6Ng089000, that was expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots (Fig. 3a). A similar trend of gene expression was observed for core genes of phenylpropanoid metabolism with several annotated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL) genes showing higher expression in roots as compared to leaves in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3b)."

To investigate in more detail the impact of drought on switchgrass specialized metabolism, we compared the transcript abundance of key genes of the terpenoid and phenylpropanoid scaffold-forming pathways in both genotypes. Due to the lack of a Cave-in-Rock genome, gene annotations are based on homology searches against the switchgrass Alamo AP13 genome (phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Pvirgatum_v5_1). Interestingly, the focal genes showed similar tissue-specific expression profiles in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock and no substantial drought-induced gene expression changes were observed (Fig. 3). For example, of the four annotated 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) genes of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, two homologs, Pavir.3KG128241 and Pavir.3NG140939, were abundant in leaves but c. 10-60-fold less in roots of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3a). Likewise, the predicted squalene synthase, Pavir.4NG340500, displayed high abundance in leaves and low gene expression in roots. However, select genes showed genotype-specific differences in their expression patterns. This included the predicted geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), Pavir.6Ng089000, that was expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots (Fig. 3a). A similar trend of gene expression was observed for core genes of phenylpropanoid metabolism with several annotated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL) genes showing higher expression in roots as compared to leaves in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3b)."

However, our metabolite analysis did not show significant drought-elicited triterpenoid accumulation that would support a similar function in switchgrass."

			"context": "Our prior research identified expansive, species-specific diterpene synthase (diTPS) and P450 families in switchgrass that form complex metabolic networks toward a range of labdane-related diterpenoids, including syn-pimarane and furanoditerpenoid compounds that occur, perhaps uniquely, in switchgrass (Fig. S5) (Pelot et al.,; Muchlinski et al.,). This pathway knowledge enabled a detailed analysis of transcriptomic alterations related to diterpenoid metabolism. Contrasting the largely similar expression patterns of MEP and mevalonate (MVA) pathway genes (Fig. 3a), hierarchical gene cluster analysis revealed distinct diTPS and P450 gene expression between Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 5). In Alamo roots, the cis-trans-clerodienyl pyrophosphate (CLPP) synthase PvCPS1 and the P450 genes, CYP71Z25, CYP71Z26, and CYP71Z28 shown to form furanoditerpenoids (Muchlinski et al.,), showed patterns of co-expression at 2 and 4 wk of drought. Similarly, the predicted syn-CPP synthases, PvCPS9 and PvCPS10, as well as two class I diTPS, PvKSL4 and PvKSL5, shown to form syn-pimaradiene compounds (Pelot et al.,), co-expressed in roots, albeit without significant drought-inducible transcript changes. In Cave-in-Rock, diTPS and P450 genes were expressed mostly in the well-watered plants and water deficiency did not elicit significant transcript accumulation. Also, contrasting roots, no drought-elicited changes in the expression of diterpenoid pathway genes was detectable in leaves of either ecotype."

Notably, MEP and MVA pathway genes showed no or very minor patterns of drought-inducible expression in Alamo or Cave-in-Rock, indicating that no major change in the production of terpenoid precursors occurs in response to drought. One exception is the putative GGPPS, Pavir.6NG089000, that is expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots and may contribute to differences in terpenoid metabolism between these genotypes. This apparent lack of drought activation of terpenoid backbone pathways suggests that terpenoid accumulation has to derive from existing precursor pools via changes in pathway branches en route to specific terpenoids. Indeed, in leaves and roots of Alamo, but not Cave-in-Rock, downstream triterpenoid-metabolic pathway genes increased under drought conditions. Interestingly, no apparent triterpenoid-biosynthetic gene clusters were identified in the switchgrass genome, which differentiates switchgrass from other plant species where triterpenoid metabolism is commonly arranged in form of often stress-inducible biosynthetic clusters (Liu et al.,; Bai et al.,). Despite the lack of apparent genomic clusters, clear co-expression patterns were observed for several TTS genes as well as sterol 3-beta-glucosyltransferases and P450 genes of the CYP71A, CYP94D and CYP90B families, thus supporting the presence of co-expressed pathways toward specific triterpenoids. The identification of diverse mixtures of diosgenin and closely related triterpenoid saponins in roots of several upland and lowland ecotypes, including Alamo and Cave-in-Rock, supports this hypothesis (Lee et al.,; Li et al.,). However, the annotated triterpenoid metabolites were not significantly enriched in response to drought in either genotype, suggesting that the inducible expression of triterpenoid pathways in Alamo is related to distinct drought-stress responses. It can be speculated that root triterpenoids serve antioxidant functions to mitigate oxidative damage caused by water deficiency as shown in Arabidopsis and other species (Pose et al.,; Nasrollahi et al.,; Puente-Garza et al.,). Also, recent studies have demonstrated bioactive triterpenoids in roots exudates of soybean (Glycine max) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) that aid the assembly of the root microbiome to confer robustness against environmental stresses (Fujimatsu et al.,; Nakayasu et al.,). While distinct microbiome responses to drought stress have been reported in upland and lowland switchgrass ecotypes (Liu et al.,), the role of specialized metabolites such as saponins in these interactions is yet to be discovered."

Indeed, genomic analysis of 732 switchgrass genotypes across 1800 km latitude range revealed an extensive correlation of genomic architecture to climatic adaptation (Lovell et al.,). Comparative morphological and physiological analysis of 49 upland and lowland ecotypes showed significant differences in the drought tolerance of different switchgrass ecotypes (Liu et al.,). Large-scale transcriptomic changes were also observed, including a drought-induced downregulation of photosynthetic genes, consistent with physiological responses such as reduced leaf water potential, reduced chlorophyll, and other photosynthetic metabolites (Meyer et al.,; Liu et al.,; Lovell et al.,).

			"context": "Aligned with the transcriptomic changes, biostatistical analysis of the untargeted metabolomic data via PERMANOVA showed that tissue type had the highest impact on metabolite composition (72.4%, ***, P < 0.001), followed by difference in genotype (2.8%, *, P < 0.028) and drought-treatment vs control (0.6%, P < 0.332) (Table S2). Hence, we further analyzed the metabolite profiles independently within each tissue type. Despite the relatively lower impact of drought treatment on metabolic alterations, under a multivariate dimension-reduction based on genotype metabolite features clustered together before water deprivation (week 0), but separated in leaves and, to a lesser extent, in roots after 4 wk of drought treatment (Fig. 6). This shift in metabolite composition was driven by several major features (Fig. 7). In leaves, most compounds showing accumulation differences in control and drought-stressed plants were classified as phospholipids based on database searches for each feature. These compounds increased in abundance in Alamo during drought treatment, whereas a decrease was observed in Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 7). In addition to predicted phospholipids, a few features were enriched in Alamo leaves under drought stress, whereas many unidentified compounds were enriched in drought-treated Cave-in-Rock leaves (Table S2). In contrast, several compounds identified as diterpenoids and triterpenoids by comparison of RT and fragmentation patterns to previously identified compounds (Muchlinski et al.,; Li et al.,) accumulated in roots of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock plants under drought stress, with a stronger increase in Alamo (Fig. 7). Other root metabolites that accumulated differentially under drought conditions either did not score significant database matches or could only be assigned to the general classes of carbohydrates, acids, or alcohols (Fig. 7). Among the few features that were generally enriched in both leaves and roots and in both ecotypes under water deficient conditions was also ABA, which was increased by c. 40-300-fold under drought (Fig. 8a; Table S6, ABA: 6.08_247.1244 m/z)."

Recent maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) studies showing induced diterpenoid formation under UV, oxidative and drought stress and decreased abiotic stress tolerance in diterpenoid-deficient maize mutants support a broader role of terpenoids in abiotic stress adaptation in monocot crops (Park et al.,; Schmelz et al.,; Horie et al.,; Vaughan et al.,; Ding et al.,)."

To investigate in more detail the impact of drought on switchgrass specialized metabolism, we compared the transcript abundance of key genes of the terpenoid and phenylpropanoid scaffold-forming pathways in both genotypes.

This included the predicted geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), Pavir.6Ng089000, that was expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots (Fig. 3a). A similar trend of gene expression was observed for core genes of phenylpropanoid metabolism with several annotated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL) genes showing higher expression in roots as compared to leaves in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3b)."

For example, of the four annotated 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) genes of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, two homologs, Pavir.3KG128241 and Pavir.3NG140939, were abundant in leaves but c. 10-60-fold less in roots of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3a). Likewise, the predicted squalene synthase, Pavir.4NG340500, displayed high abundance in leaves and low gene expression in roots. However, select genes showed genotype-specific differences in their expression patterns. This included the predicted geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), Pavir.6Ng089000, that was expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots (Fig. 3a). A similar trend of gene expression was observed for core genes of phenylpropanoid metabolism with several annotated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL) genes showing higher expression in roots as compared to leaves in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3b)."

Accumulation of sucrose and ABA in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock tissues is consistent with previously demonstrated switchgrass drought responses (Liu et al.,). In addition, the observed major contribution of phospholipids to metabolic alterations in leaves of both genotypes may be related to an upregulation of pathways involved in membrane lipid systems and cell wall biosynthesis as shown in, for example, drought-resistant maize lines (Zhang et al.,). Additional phospholipid roles in drought tolerance may include maintenance of membrane integrity or mitigation of drought-related cell damage (Hamrouni et al.,), as well as signaling processes during water deficiency as reported in selected drought-resistant species (Quartacci et al.,; Moradi et al.,). Contrasting drought-related flavonoid functions in, for example, wheat (Triticum aestivum) and other species (Ma et al.,; Gai et al.,), leaf flavonoid glycosides did not accumulate in response to drought in either switchgrass genotype, despite a moderate upregulation of select pathway genes such as CHS in drought-stressed plants. Similarly, steroidal and triterpenoid saponins were identified in switchgrass leaves, and have been shown to increase as part of the leaf cuticular waxes in response to drought (Kim et al.,). However, our metabolite analysis did not show significant drought-elicited triterpenoid accumulation that would support a similar function in switchgrass."

Notably, among the 11 AWPM19-like genes, Alamo and Cave-in-Rock featured distinct genes (Pavir.2NG274300 in Alamo vs Pavir.9NG018700 in Cave-in-Rock) as the most differentially expressed AWPM19-like genes. The increased expression of known drought-associated genes supports the drought response in both genotypes, despite the visual lack of a wilting phenotype in Alamo plants. Along the lack of a wilting phenotype in Alamo plants, no genes associated with cell death and necrosis processes such as caspases and proteases were present among the differentially upregulated genes (i.e. featured an P adj > 0.05 with a |log2FC| < 1), supporting that the observed expression patterns represent a drought response rather than being associated with drought-related plant death."

For example, in roots of both genotypes dehydrin (log2FC Alamo = 5.2, CiR = 6.24) and other Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA) genes (log2FC Alamo = 4.34, CiR = 5.78), as well as several AWPM19-like plasma-membrane-associated abscisic acid (ABA) influx transporters implicated with drought tolerance (log2FC Alamo = 6.25, CiR = 6.04) were highly upregulated (Fig. 1; Table S1). Notably, among the 11 AWPM19-like genes, Alamo and Cave-in-Rock featured distinct genes (Pavir.2NG274300 in Alamo vs Pavir.9NG018700 in Cave-in-Rock) as the most differentially expressed AWPM19-like genes. The increased expression of known drought-associated genes supports the drought response in both genotypes, despite the visual lack of a wilting phenotype in Alamo plants. Along the lack of a wilting phenotype in Alamo plants, no genes associated with cell death and necrosis processes such as caspases and proteases were present among the differentially upregulated genes (i.e. featured an P adj > 0.05 with a |log2FC| < 1), supporting that the observed expression patterns represent a drought response rather than being associated with drought-related plant death."

To investigate in more detail the impact of drought on switchgrass specialized metabolism, we compared the transcript abundance of key genes of the terpenoid and phenylpropanoid scaffold-forming pathways in both genotypes. Due to the lack of a Cave-in-Rock genome, gene annotations are based on homology searches against the switchgrass Alamo AP13 genome (phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Pvirgatum_v5_1). Interestingly, the focal genes showed similar tissue-specific expression profiles in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock and no substantial drought-induced gene expression changes were observed (Fig. 3). For example, of the four annotated 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) genes of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, two homologs, Pavir.3KG128241 and Pavir.3NG140939, were abundant in leaves but c. 10-60-fold less in roots of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3a). Likewise, the predicted squalene synthase, Pavir.4NG340500, displayed high abundance in leaves and low gene expression in roots. However, select genes showed genotype-specific differences in their expression patterns. This included the predicted geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), Pavir.6Ng089000, that was expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots (Fig. 3a). A similar trend of gene expression was observed for core genes of phenylpropanoid metabolism with several annotated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL) genes showing higher expression in roots as compared to leaves in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3b)."

			"context": "The enrichment of terpenoid and phenylpropanoid metabolism is consistent with prior studies illustrating ecotype-specific profiles of steroidal saponins and flavonoids (Li et al.,), and the upregulation, albeit at moderate levels, of switchgrass terpenoid- and phenylpropanoid-metabolic pathways in response to drought, UV irradiation and oxidative stress (Meyer et al.,; Pelot et al.,; Muchlinski et al.,; Tiedge et al.,). To investigate in more detail the impact of drought on switchgrass specialized metabolism, we compared the transcript abundance of key genes of the terpenoid and phenylpropanoid scaffold-forming pathways in both genotypes. Due to the lack of a Cave-in-Rock genome, gene annotations are based on homology searches against the switchgrass Alamo AP13 genome (phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Pvirgatum_v5_1). Interestingly, the focal genes showed similar tissue-specific expression profiles in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock and no substantial drought-induced gene expression changes were observed (Fig. 3). For example, of the four annotated 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) genes of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, two homologs, Pavir.3KG128241 and Pavir.3NG140939, were abundant in leaves but c. 10-60-fold less in roots of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3a). Likewise, the predicted squalene synthase, Pavir.4NG340500, displayed high abundance in leaves and low gene expression in roots. However, select genes showed genotype-specific differences in their expression patterns. This included the predicted geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), Pavir.6Ng089000, that was expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots (Fig. 3a). A similar trend of gene expression was observed for core genes of phenylpropanoid metabolism with several annotated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL) genes showing higher expression in roots as compared to leaves in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3b)."

To investigate in more detail the impact of drought on switchgrass specialized metabolism, we compared the transcript abundance of key genes of the terpenoid and phenylpropanoid scaffold-forming pathways in both genotypes.

However, select genes showed genotype-specific differences in their expression patterns. This included the predicted geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), Pavir.6Ng089000, that was expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots (Fig. 3a). A similar trend of gene expression was observed for core genes of phenylpropanoid metabolism with several annotated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL) genes showing higher expression in roots as compared to leaves in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3b)."

To investigate in more detail the impact of drought on switchgrass specialized metabolism, we compared the transcript abundance of key genes of the terpenoid and phenylpropanoid scaffold-forming pathways in both genotypes. Due to the lack of a Cave-in-Rock genome, gene annotations are based on homology searches against the switchgrass Alamo AP13 genome (phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Pvirgatum_v5_1). Interestingly, the focal genes showed similar tissue-specific expression profiles in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock and no substantial drought-induced gene expression changes were observed (Fig. 3). For example, of the four annotated 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) genes of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, two homologs, Pavir.3KG128241 and Pavir.3NG140939, were abundant in leaves but c. 10-60-fold less in roots of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3a). Likewise, the predicted squalene synthase, Pavir.4NG340500, displayed high abundance in leaves and low gene expression in roots. However, select genes showed genotype-specific differences in their expression patterns. This included the predicted geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), Pavir.6Ng089000, that was expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots (Fig. 3a). A similar trend of gene expression was observed for core genes of phenylpropanoid metabolism with several annotated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL) genes showing higher expression in roots as compared to leaves in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3b)."

For example, of the four annotated 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) genes of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, two homologs, Pavir.3KG128241 and Pavir.3NG140939, were abundant in leaves but c. 10-60-fold less in roots of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3a). Likewise, the predicted squalene synthase, Pavir.4NG340500, displayed high abundance in leaves and low gene expression in roots. However, select genes showed genotype-specific differences in their expression patterns. This included the predicted geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), Pavir.6Ng089000, that was expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots (Fig. 3a). A similar trend of gene expression was observed for core genes of phenylpropanoid metabolism with several annotated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL) genes showing higher expression in roots as compared to leaves in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3b)."

To investigate in more detail the impact of drought on switchgrass specialized metabolism, we compared the transcript abundance of key genes of the terpenoid and phenylpropanoid scaffold-forming pathways in both genotypes. Due to the lack of a Cave-in-Rock genome, gene annotations are based on homology searches against the switchgrass Alamo AP13 genome (phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Pvirgatum_v5_1). Interestingly, the focal genes showed similar tissue-specific expression profiles in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock and no substantial drought-induced gene expression changes were observed (Fig. 3). For example, of the four annotated 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) genes of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, two homologs, Pavir.3KG128241 and Pavir.3NG140939, were abundant in leaves but c. 10-60-fold less in roots of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3a). Likewise, the predicted squalene synthase, Pavir.4NG340500, displayed high abundance in leaves and low gene expression in roots. However, select genes showed genotype-specific differences in their expression patterns. This included the predicted geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), Pavir.6Ng089000, that was expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots (Fig. 3a). A similar trend of gene expression was observed for core genes of phenylpropanoid metabolism with several annotated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL) genes showing higher expression in roots as compared to leaves in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3b)."

To investigate in more detail the impact of drought on switchgrass specialized metabolism, we compared the transcript abundance of key genes of the terpenoid and phenylpropanoid scaffold-forming pathways in both genotypes. Due to the lack of a Cave-in-Rock genome, gene annotations are based on homology searches against the switchgrass Alamo AP13 genome (phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/info/Pvirgatum_v5_1). Interestingly, the focal genes showed similar tissue-specific expression profiles in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock and no substantial drought-induced gene expression changes were observed (Fig. 3). For example, of the four annotated 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase (DXS) genes of the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway, two homologs, Pavir.3KG128241 and Pavir.3NG140939, were abundant in leaves but c. 10-60-fold less in roots of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3a). Likewise, the predicted squalene synthase, Pavir.4NG340500, displayed high abundance in leaves and low gene expression in roots. However, select genes showed genotype-specific differences in their expression patterns. This included the predicted geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase (GGPPS), Pavir.6Ng089000, that was expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots (Fig. 3a). A similar trend of gene expression was observed for core genes of phenylpropanoid metabolism with several annotated phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), and 4-coumaroyl-CoA ligase (4CL) genes showing higher expression in roots as compared to leaves in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 3b)."

Notably, MEP and MVA pathway genes showed no or very minor patterns of drought-inducible expression in Alamo or Cave-in-Rock, indicating that no major change in the production of terpenoid precursors occurs in response to drought. One exception is the putative GGPPS, Pavir.6NG089000, that is expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots and may contribute to differences in terpenoid metabolism between these genotypes. This apparent lack of drought activation of terpenoid backbone pathways suggests that terpenoid accumulation has to derive from existing precursor pools via changes in pathway branches en route to specific terpenoids. Indeed, in leaves and roots of Alamo, but not Cave-in-Rock, downstream triterpenoid-metabolic pathway genes increased under drought conditions. Interestingly, no apparent triterpenoid-biosynthetic gene clusters were identified in the switchgrass genome, which differentiates switchgrass from other plant species where triterpenoid metabolism is commonly arranged in form of often stress-inducible biosynthetic clusters (Liu et al.,; Bai et al.,). Despite the lack of apparent genomic clusters, clear co-expression patterns were observed for several TTS genes as well as sterol 3-beta-glucosyltransferases and P450 genes of the CYP71A, CYP94D and CYP90B families, thus supporting the presence of co-expressed pathways toward specific triterpenoids. The identification of diverse mixtures of diosgenin and closely related triterpenoid saponins in roots of several upland and lowland ecotypes, including Alamo and Cave-in-Rock, supports this hypothesis (Lee et al.,; Li et al.,). However, the annotated triterpenoid metabolites were not significantly enriched in response to drought in either genotype, suggesting that the inducible expression of triterpenoid pathways in Alamo is related to distinct drought-stress responses. It can be speculated that root triterpenoids serve antioxidant functions to mitigate oxidative damage caused by water deficiency as shown in Arabidopsis and other species (Pose et al.,; Nasrollahi et al.,; Puente-Garza et al.,). Also, recent studies have demonstrated bioactive triterpenoids in roots exudates of soybean (Glycine max) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) that aid the assembly of the root microbiome to confer robustness against environmental stresses (Fujimatsu et al.,; Nakayasu et al.,). While distinct microbiome responses to drought stress have been reported in upland and lowland switchgrass ecotypes (Liu et al.,), the role of specialized metabolites such as saponins in these interactions is yet to be discovered."

			"context": "Different from leaves, steroidal and other triterpenoid saponins as well as diterpenoids constituted the major determinants of metabolic differences in drought-stressed roots. Notably, MEP and MVA pathway genes showed no or very minor patterns of drought-inducible expression in Alamo or Cave-in-Rock, indicating that no major change in the production of terpenoid precursors occurs in response to drought. One exception is the putative GGPPS, Pavir.6NG089000, that is expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots and may contribute to differences in terpenoid metabolism between these genotypes. This apparent lack of drought activation of terpenoid backbone pathways suggests that terpenoid accumulation has to derive from existing precursor pools via changes in pathway branches en route to specific terpenoids. Indeed, in leaves and roots of Alamo, but not Cave-in-Rock, downstream triterpenoid-metabolic pathway genes increased under drought conditions. Interestingly, no apparent triterpenoid-biosynthetic gene clusters were identified in the switchgrass genome, which differentiates switchgrass from other plant species where triterpenoid metabolism is commonly arranged in form of often stress-inducible biosynthetic clusters (Liu et al.,; Bai et al.,). Despite the lack of apparent genomic clusters, clear co-expression patterns were observed for several TTS genes as well as sterol 3-beta-glucosyltransferases and P450 genes of the CYP71A, CYP94D and CYP90B families, thus supporting the presence of co-expressed pathways toward specific triterpenoids. The identification of diverse mixtures of diosgenin and closely related triterpenoid saponins in roots of several upland and lowland ecotypes, including Alamo and Cave-in-Rock, supports this hypothesis (Lee et al.,; Li et al.,). However, the annotated triterpenoid metabolites were not significantly enriched in response to drought in either genotype, suggesting that the inducible expression of triterpenoid pathways in Alamo is related to distinct drought-stress responses. It can be speculated that root triterpenoids serve antioxidant functions to mitigate oxidative damage caused by water deficiency as shown in Arabidopsis and other species (Pose et al.,; Nasrollahi et al.,; Puente-Garza et al.,). Also, recent studies have demonstrated bioactive triterpenoids in roots exudates of soybean (Glycine max) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) that aid the assembly of the root microbiome to confer robustness against environmental stresses (Fujimatsu et al.,; Nakayasu et al.,). While distinct microbiome responses to drought stress have been reported in upland and lowland switchgrass ecotypes (Liu et al.,), the role of specialized metabolites such as saponins in these interactions is yet to be discovered."

Although requiring further biological studies, the higher abundance of these diterpenoids in Alamo as compared to Cave-in-Rock may contribute to the distinct stress resilience in these genotypes. In addition, accumulation in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock support a role of these metabolites in drought responses rather than general stress responses associated with the more pronounced wilting phenotype observed in Cave-in-Rock. Structural analysis identified three compounds as oxygenated clerodane furanoditerpenoids, named here panicoloid A-C, which likely represent derivatives of furanoditerpenoid scaffolds recently identified in switchgrass (Pelot et al.,; Muchlinski et al.,). Notably, the enantiomeric stereochemistry of panicoloid B and panicoloid C is likely derived from the activity of yet unidentified diTPS functionally related to the CLPP synthase PvCPS1. Drought-induced gene expression increases of characterized pathway genes toward clerodane-type furanoditerpenoids, including the diTPS PvCPS1 and the P450 genes CYP71Z25, CYP71Z26 and CYP71Z28 supports a role of these pathway genes in panicoloid biosynthesis. Additional co-expression of select P450s of the CYP99 family and predicted short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, shown to function in specialized diterpenoid metabolism in maize and rice (Swaminathan et al.,), suggests possible functions in the position-specific oxygenation reactions toward panicoloid biosynthesis. Similar to triterpenoid metabolism, the lack of co-expression of these genes in the drought-susceptible Cave-in-Rock genotype may support a role of panicoloids in switchgrass drought responses. Combined with the abundance of yet unidentified diterpenoids in switchgrass roots, drought-elicited co-expression patterns of additional predicted syn-CPP synthase genes (PvCPS9, PvCPS10) and characterized class I diTPS forming syn-pimarane diterpenoids (PvKSL4, PvKSL5) suggest the presence of a broader diversity of drought-induced diterpenoids in switchgrass. Similar clerodane-type furanoditerpenoids have also been identified in species of Vellozia spec. (Pinto et al.,), Solidago spec. (Anthonsen et al.,; McCrindle et al.,), and Croton campestris (El Babili et al.,), where they will have evolved independently given the phylogenetic distance between these plant genera. While the drought-induced expression of diterpenoid-metabolic genes and associated accumulation of panicoloids and possibly other diterpenoids supports a role in switchgrass drought tolerance, the underlying mechanisms will require future investigation. However, drought-related diterpenoid bioactivities have recently been supported in other monocots. For example, maize studies demonstrated the accumulation of specialized kauralexin and dolabralexin diterpenoids in response to oxidative, drought and salinity stress (Christensen et al.,; Mafu et al.,), and diterpenoid-deficient maize mutants show decreased resilience to abiotic stress (Vaughan et al.,). Additionally, antioxidative functions in relation to drought stress have been shown for select diterpenoids (Munne-Bosch & Alegre,), and diterpenoid roles in the root microbiome assembly have been suggested based on changes in the microbiome composition in the kauralexin- and dolabralexin-deficient maize an2 mutant (Murphy et al.,)."

In Alamo roots, the cis-trans-clerodienyl pyrophosphate (CLPP) synthase PvCPS1 and the P450 genes, CYP71Z25, CYP71Z26, and CYP71Z28 shown to form furanoditerpenoids (Muchlinski et al.,), showed patterns of co-expression at 2 and 4 wk of drought. Similarly, the predicted syn-CPP synthases, PvCPS9 and PvCPS10, as well as two class I diTPS, PvKSL4 and PvKSL5, shown to form syn-pimaradiene compounds (Pelot et al.,), co-expressed in roots, albeit without significant drought-inducible transcript changes. In Cave-in-Rock, diTPS and P450 genes were expressed mostly in the well-watered plants and water deficiency did not elicit significant transcript accumulation. Also, contrasting roots, no drought-elicited changes in the expression of diterpenoid pathway genes was detectable in leaves of either ecotype."

			"context": "Unlike root triterpenoids, significant drought-induced accumulation of several diterpenoids in roots supports a role in drought response mechanisms. Although requiring further biological studies, the higher abundance of these diterpenoids in Alamo as compared to Cave-in-Rock may contribute to the distinct stress resilience in these genotypes. In addition, accumulation in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock support a role of these metabolites in drought responses rather than general stress responses associated with the more pronounced wilting phenotype observed in Cave-in-Rock. Structural analysis identified three compounds as oxygenated clerodane furanoditerpenoids, named here panicoloid A-C, which likely represent derivatives of furanoditerpenoid scaffolds recently identified in switchgrass (Pelot et al.,; Muchlinski et al.,). Notably, the enantiomeric stereochemistry of panicoloid B and panicoloid C is likely derived from the activity of yet unidentified diTPS functionally related to the CLPP synthase PvCPS1. Drought-induced gene expression increases of characterized pathway genes toward clerodane-type furanoditerpenoids, including the diTPS PvCPS1 and the P450 genes CYP71Z25, CYP71Z26 and CYP71Z28 supports a role of these pathway genes in panicoloid biosynthesis. Additional co-expression of select P450s of the CYP99 family and predicted short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, shown to function in specialized diterpenoid metabolism in maize and rice (Swaminathan et al.,), suggests possible functions in the position-specific oxygenation reactions toward panicoloid biosynthesis. Similar to triterpenoid metabolism, the lack of co-expression of these genes in the drought-susceptible Cave-in-Rock genotype may support a role of panicoloids in switchgrass drought responses. Combined with the abundance of yet unidentified diterpenoids in switchgrass roots, drought-elicited co-expression patterns of additional predicted syn-CPP synthase genes (PvCPS9, PvCPS10) and characterized class I diTPS forming syn-pimarane diterpenoids (PvKSL4, PvKSL5) suggest the presence of a broader diversity of drought-induced diterpenoids in switchgrass. Similar clerodane-type furanoditerpenoids have also been identified in species of Vellozia spec. (Pinto et al.,), Solidago spec. (Anthonsen et al.,; McCrindle et al.,), and Croton campestris (El Babili et al.,), where they will have evolved independently given the phylogenetic distance between these plant genera. While the drought-induced expression of diterpenoid-metabolic genes and associated accumulation of panicoloids and possibly other diterpenoids supports a role in switchgrass drought tolerance, the underlying mechanisms will require future investigation. However, drought-related diterpenoid bioactivities have recently been supported in other monocots. For example, maize studies demonstrated the accumulation of specialized kauralexin and dolabralexin diterpenoids in response to oxidative, drought and salinity stress (Christensen et al.,; Mafu et al.,), and diterpenoid-deficient maize mutants show decreased resilience to abiotic stress (Vaughan et al.,). Additionally, antioxidative functions in relation to drought stress have been shown for select diterpenoids (Munne-Bosch & Alegre,), and diterpenoid roles in the root microbiome assembly have been suggested based on changes in the microbiome composition in the kauralexin- and dolabralexin-deficient maize an2 mutant (Murphy et al.,)."

Additional co-expression of select P450s of the CYP99 family and predicted short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, shown to function in specialized diterpenoid metabolism in maize and rice (Swaminathan et al.,), suggests possible functions in the position-specific oxygenation reactions toward panicoloid biosynthesis. Similar to triterpenoid metabolism, the lack of co-expression of these genes in the drought-susceptible Cave-in-Rock genotype may support a role of panicoloids in switchgrass drought responses. Combined with the abundance of yet unidentified diterpenoids in switchgrass roots, drought-elicited co-expression patterns of additional predicted syn-CPP synthase genes (PvCPS9, PvCPS10) and characterized class I diTPS forming syn-pimarane diterpenoids (PvKSL4, PvKSL5) suggest the presence of a broader diversity of drought-induced diterpenoids in switchgrass. Similar clerodane-type furanoditerpenoids have also been identified in species of Vellozia spec. (Pinto et al.,), Solidago spec. (Anthonsen et al.,; McCrindle et al.,), and Croton campestris (El Babili et al.,), where they will have evolved independently given the phylogenetic distance between these plant genera. While the drought-induced expression of diterpenoid-metabolic genes and associated accumulation of panicoloids and possibly other diterpenoids supports a role in switchgrass drought tolerance, the underlying mechanisms will require future investigation. However, drought-related diterpenoid bioactivities have recently been supported in other monocots. For example, maize studies demonstrated the accumulation of specialized kauralexin and dolabralexin diterpenoids in response to oxidative, drought and salinity stress (Christensen et al.,; Mafu et al.,), and diterpenoid-deficient maize mutants show decreased resilience to abiotic stress (Vaughan et al.,). Additionally, antioxidative functions in relation to drought stress have been shown for select diterpenoids (Munne-Bosch & Alegre,), and diterpenoid roles in the root microbiome assembly have been suggested based on changes in the microbiome composition in the kauralexin- and dolabralexin-deficient maize an2 mutant (Murphy et al.,)."

			"context": "Considering that predicted specialized steroidal and triterpenoid saponins and diterpenoids contribute substantially to the metabolic differences between Alamo and Cave-in-Rock roots, we examined these compounds in more detail in leaf and root extracts after 4 wk of drought where the physiological stress symptoms were most pronounced. Several predicted flavonoid glycosides were identified in leaves of Alamo and Cave-in-Rock plants but were absent in root tissue. However, these compounds showed no or only minimal patterns of drought-elicited accumulation (Fig. 8a). In addition, a range of distinct terpenoid metabolites was identified. Among these metabolites, the largest group represented recently identified steroidal or triterpenoid saponins (Li et al.,), showing distinct profiles across tissues and genotypes. Triterpenoid saponins occurred predominantly in leaves of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock plants, whereas the larger group of steroidal saponins were present in leaves and/or roots and occurred predominantly in either Alamo or Cave-in-Rock plants. Despite the overall abundance of these saponins, the vast majority of the annotated metabolites were not significantly enriched upon drought stress (P <= 0.05; Table S6). In addition to the larger group of triterpenoids, 11 compounds predicted as specialized diterpenoids were identified, the majority of which occurred predominantly in Alamo roots and were absent or abundant at only low levels in Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 8a). Notably, two pairs of predictably isomeric diterpenoids were detected in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock that showed substantial accumulation mostly in drought-stressed roots. One metabolite pair at RTs of 9.06 min and 9.26 min featured a dominant precursor mass ion of m/z 317 [M + H]+ and one compound pair at RTs of 11.50 min and 11.72 min featured a dominant ion of m/z 317 [M + H]+. Together with the presence of additional mass ions of m/z 257, m/z 189, m/z 177 or m/z 135, these fragmentation patterns suggested that these compounds represent labdane-related diterpenoids carrying one or more oxygenation functions (Fig. S4). To elucidate the precise structure of these diterpenoids, metabolites were extracted from mature Cave-in-Rock roots and purified via liquid-liquid phase partitioning followed by HPLC. Purified samples (0.4-0.8 mg for each compound) of both m/z 301 isomers and both m/z 317 diterpenoid isomers were used for 1D (1H and 13C) and 2D (HSQC, COSY, HMBC and NOESY) NMR analyses. Collectively, the generated data identified the m/z 301 diterpenoids as 15,16-epoxy-2-oxo-5alpha8alpha-cleroda-3,13(16),l4-triene and its C19 enantiomer, while the earlier eluting diterpenoid m/z 317 was identified as 2-oxo-5alpha8alpha-cleroda-3,13-dien-16,l5-olide, together designated as panicoloid A, panicoloid B, and panicoloid C respectively (Figs 8b, S6). Insufficient abundance and purity of the later eluting m/z 317 diterpenoid isomer prevented structural analysis of this metabolite. Based on the similar mass fragmentation pattern and RT compared to the other m/z 317 isomer (Fig. S4), it is plausible that this compound represents its enantiomeric isomer and is tentatively named panicoloid D. The identified diterpenoids represent derivatives of previously identified switchgrass furanoditerpenoids that feature additional carbonyl functions at C2 and/or C14 and are collectively named here as the group of panicoloids (Fig. S4)."

			"context": "Unlike root triterpenoids, significant drought-induced accumulation of several diterpenoids in roots supports a role in drought response mechanisms. Although requiring further biological studies, the higher abundance of these diterpenoids in Alamo as compared to Cave-in-Rock may contribute to the distinct stress resilience in these genotypes. In addition, accumulation in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock support a role of these metabolites in drought responses rather than general stress responses associated with the more pronounced wilting phenotype observed in Cave-in-Rock. Structural analysis identified three compounds as oxygenated clerodane furanoditerpenoids, named here panicoloid A-C, which likely represent derivatives of furanoditerpenoid scaffolds recently identified in switchgrass (Pelot et al.,; Muchlinski et al.,). Notably, the enantiomeric stereochemistry of panicoloid B and panicoloid C is likely derived from the activity of yet unidentified diTPS functionally related to the CLPP synthase PvCPS1. Drought-induced gene expression increases of characterized pathway genes toward clerodane-type furanoditerpenoids, including the diTPS PvCPS1 and the P450 genes CYP71Z25, CYP71Z26 and CYP71Z28 supports a role of these pathway genes in panicoloid biosynthesis. Additional co-expression of select P450s of the CYP99 family and predicted short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, shown to function in specialized diterpenoid metabolism in maize and rice (Swaminathan et al.,), suggests possible functions in the position-specific oxygenation reactions toward panicoloid biosynthesis. Similar to triterpenoid metabolism, the lack of co-expression of these genes in the drought-susceptible Cave-in-Rock genotype may support a role of panicoloids in switchgrass drought responses. Combined with the abundance of yet unidentified diterpenoids in switchgrass roots, drought-elicited co-expression patterns of additional predicted syn-CPP synthase genes (PvCPS9, PvCPS10) and characterized class I diTPS forming syn-pimarane diterpenoids (PvKSL4, PvKSL5) suggest the presence of a broader diversity of drought-induced diterpenoids in switchgrass. Similar clerodane-type furanoditerpenoids have also been identified in species of Vellozia spec. (Pinto et al.,), Solidago spec. (Anthonsen et al.,; McCrindle et al.,), and Croton campestris (El Babili et al.,), where they will have evolved independently given the phylogenetic distance between these plant genera. While the drought-induced expression of diterpenoid-metabolic genes and associated accumulation of panicoloids and possibly other diterpenoids supports a role in switchgrass drought tolerance, the underlying mechanisms will require future investigation. However, drought-related diterpenoid bioactivities have recently been supported in other monocots. For example, maize studies demonstrated the accumulation of specialized kauralexin and dolabralexin diterpenoids in response to oxidative, drought and salinity stress (Christensen et al.,; Mafu et al.,), and diterpenoid-deficient maize mutants show decreased resilience to abiotic stress (Vaughan et al.,). Additionally, antioxidative functions in relation to drought stress have been shown for select diterpenoids (Munne-Bosch & Alegre,), and diterpenoid roles in the root microbiome assembly have been suggested based on changes in the microbiome composition in the kauralexin- and dolabralexin-deficient maize an2 mutant (Murphy et al.,)."

Additional phospholipid roles in drought tolerance may include maintenance of membrane integrity or mitigation of drought-related cell damage (Hamrouni et al.,), as well as signaling processes during water deficiency as reported in selected drought-resistant species (Quartacci et al.,; Moradi et al.,). Contrasting drought-related flavonoid functions in, for example, wheat (Triticum aestivum) and other species (Ma et al.,; Gai et al.,), leaf flavonoid glycosides did not accumulate in response to drought in either switchgrass genotype, despite a moderate upregulation of select pathway genes such as CHS in drought-stressed plants. Similarly, steroidal and triterpenoid saponins were identified in switchgrass leaves, and have been shown to increase as part of the leaf cuticular waxes in response to drought (Kim et al.,). However, our metabolite analysis did not show significant drought-elicited triterpenoid accumulation that would support a similar function in switchgrass."

Accumulation of sucrose and ABA in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock tissues is consistent with previously demonstrated switchgrass drought responses (Liu et al.,). In addition, the observed major contribution of phospholipids to metabolic alterations in leaves of both genotypes may be related to an upregulation of pathways involved in membrane lipid systems and cell wall biosynthesis as shown in, for example, drought-resistant maize lines (Zhang et al.,). Additional phospholipid roles in drought tolerance may include maintenance of membrane integrity or mitigation of drought-related cell damage (Hamrouni et al.,), as well as signaling processes during water deficiency as reported in selected drought-resistant species (Quartacci et al.,; Moradi et al.,). Contrasting drought-related flavonoid functions in, for example, wheat (Triticum aestivum) and other species (Ma et al.,; Gai et al.,), leaf flavonoid glycosides did not accumulate in response to drought in either switchgrass genotype, despite a moderate upregulation of select pathway genes such as CHS in drought-stressed plants. Similarly, steroidal and triterpenoid saponins were identified in switchgrass leaves, and have been shown to increase as part of the leaf cuticular waxes in response to drought (Kim et al.,). However, our metabolite analysis did not show significant drought-elicited triterpenoid accumulation that would support a similar function in switchgrass."

Although requiring further biological studies, the higher abundance of these diterpenoids in Alamo as compared to Cave-in-Rock may contribute to the distinct stress resilience in these genotypes. In addition, accumulation in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock support a role of these metabolites in drought responses rather than general stress responses associated with the more pronounced wilting phenotype observed in Cave-in-Rock. Structural analysis identified three compounds as oxygenated clerodane furanoditerpenoids, named here panicoloid A-C, which likely represent derivatives of furanoditerpenoid scaffolds recently identified in switchgrass (Pelot et al.,; Muchlinski et al.,). Notably, the enantiomeric stereochemistry of panicoloid B and panicoloid C is likely derived from the activity of yet unidentified diTPS functionally related to the CLPP synthase PvCPS1. Drought-induced gene expression increases of characterized pathway genes toward clerodane-type furanoditerpenoids, including the diTPS PvCPS1 and the P450 genes CYP71Z25, CYP71Z26 and CYP71Z28 supports a role of these pathway genes in panicoloid biosynthesis. Additional co-expression of select P450s of the CYP99 family and predicted short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, shown to function in specialized diterpenoid metabolism in maize and rice (Swaminathan et al.,), suggests possible functions in the position-specific oxygenation reactions toward panicoloid biosynthesis. Similar to triterpenoid metabolism, the lack of co-expression of these genes in the drought-susceptible Cave-in-Rock genotype may support a role of panicoloids in switchgrass drought responses. Combined with the abundance of yet unidentified diterpenoids in switchgrass roots, drought-elicited co-expression patterns of additional predicted syn-CPP synthase genes (PvCPS9, PvCPS10) and characterized class I diTPS forming syn-pimarane diterpenoids (PvKSL4, PvKSL5) suggest the presence of a broader diversity of drought-induced diterpenoids in switchgrass. Similar clerodane-type furanoditerpenoids have also been identified in species of Vellozia spec. (Pinto et al.,), Solidago spec. (Anthonsen et al.,; McCrindle et al.,), and Croton campestris (El Babili et al.,), where they will have evolved independently given the phylogenetic distance between these plant genera. While the drought-induced expression of diterpenoid-metabolic genes and associated accumulation of panicoloids and possibly other diterpenoids supports a role in switchgrass drought tolerance, the underlying mechanisms will require future investigation. However, drought-related diterpenoid bioactivities have recently been supported in other monocots. For example, maize studies demonstrated the accumulation of specialized kauralexin and dolabralexin diterpenoids in response to oxidative, drought and salinity stress (Christensen et al.,; Mafu et al.,), and diterpenoid-deficient maize mutants show decreased resilience to abiotic stress (Vaughan et al.,). Additionally, antioxidative functions in relation to drought stress have been shown for select diterpenoids (Munne-Bosch & Alegre,), and diterpenoid roles in the root microbiome assembly have been suggested based on changes in the microbiome composition in the kauralexin- and dolabralexin-deficient maize an2 mutant (Murphy et al.,)."

Although requiring further biological studies, the higher abundance of these diterpenoids in Alamo as compared to Cave-in-Rock may contribute to the distinct stress resilience in these genotypes. In addition, accumulation in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock support a role of these metabolites in drought responses rather than general stress responses associated with the more pronounced wilting phenotype observed in Cave-in-Rock. Structural analysis identified three compounds as oxygenated clerodane furanoditerpenoids, named here panicoloid A-C, which likely represent derivatives of furanoditerpenoid scaffolds recently identified in switchgrass (Pelot et al.,; Muchlinski et al.,). Notably, the enantiomeric stereochemistry of panicoloid B and panicoloid C is likely derived from the activity of yet unidentified diTPS functionally related to the CLPP synthase PvCPS1. Drought-induced gene expression increases of characterized pathway genes toward clerodane-type furanoditerpenoids, including the diTPS PvCPS1 and the P450 genes CYP71Z25, CYP71Z26 and CYP71Z28 supports a role of these pathway genes in panicoloid biosynthesis. Additional co-expression of select P450s of the CYP99 family and predicted short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, shown to function in specialized diterpenoid metabolism in maize and rice (Swaminathan et al.,), suggests possible functions in the position-specific oxygenation reactions toward panicoloid biosynthesis. Similar to triterpenoid metabolism, the lack of co-expression of these genes in the drought-susceptible Cave-in-Rock genotype may support a role of panicoloids in switchgrass drought responses. Combined with the abundance of yet unidentified diterpenoids in switchgrass roots, drought-elicited co-expression patterns of additional predicted syn-CPP synthase genes (PvCPS9, PvCPS10) and characterized class I diTPS forming syn-pimarane diterpenoids (PvKSL4, PvKSL5) suggest the presence of a broader diversity of drought-induced diterpenoids in switchgrass. Similar clerodane-type furanoditerpenoids have also been identified in species of Vellozia spec. (Pinto et al.,), Solidago spec. (Anthonsen et al.,; McCrindle et al.,), and Croton campestris (El Babili et al.,), where they will have evolved independently given the phylogenetic distance between these plant genera. While the drought-induced expression of diterpenoid-metabolic genes and associated accumulation of panicoloids and possibly other diterpenoids supports a role in switchgrass drought tolerance, the underlying mechanisms will require future investigation. However, drought-related diterpenoid bioactivities have recently been supported in other monocots. For example, maize studies demonstrated the accumulation of specialized kauralexin and dolabralexin diterpenoids in response to oxidative, drought and salinity stress (Christensen et al.,; Mafu et al.,), and diterpenoid-deficient maize mutants show decreased resilience to abiotic stress (Vaughan et al.,). Additionally, antioxidative functions in relation to drought stress have been shown for select diterpenoids (Munne-Bosch & Alegre,), and diterpenoid roles in the root microbiome assembly have been suggested based on changes in the microbiome composition in the kauralexin- and dolabralexin-deficient maize an2 mutant (Murphy et al.,)."

			"context": "Considering that predicted specialized steroidal and triterpenoid saponins and diterpenoids contribute substantially to the metabolic differences between Alamo and Cave-in-Rock roots, we examined these compounds in more detail in leaf and root extracts after 4 wk of drought where the physiological stress symptoms were most pronounced. Several predicted flavonoid glycosides were identified in leaves of Alamo and Cave-in-Rock plants but were absent in root tissue. However, these compounds showed no or only minimal patterns of drought-elicited accumulation (Fig. 8a). In addition, a range of distinct terpenoid metabolites was identified. Among these metabolites, the largest group represented recently identified steroidal or triterpenoid saponins (Li et al.,), showing distinct profiles across tissues and genotypes. Triterpenoid saponins occurred predominantly in leaves of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock plants, whereas the larger group of steroidal saponins were present in leaves and/or roots and occurred predominantly in either Alamo or Cave-in-Rock plants. Despite the overall abundance of these saponins, the vast majority of the annotated metabolites were not significantly enriched upon drought stress (P <= 0.05; Table S6). In addition to the larger group of triterpenoids, 11 compounds predicted as specialized diterpenoids were identified, the majority of which occurred predominantly in Alamo roots and were absent or abundant at only low levels in Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 8a). Notably, two pairs of predictably isomeric diterpenoids were detected in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock that showed substantial accumulation mostly in drought-stressed roots. One metabolite pair at RTs of 9.06 min and 9.26 min featured a dominant precursor mass ion of m/z 317 [M + H]+ and one compound pair at RTs of 11.50 min and 11.72 min featured a dominant ion of m/z 317 [M + H]+. Together with the presence of additional mass ions of m/z 257, m/z 189, m/z 177 or m/z 135, these fragmentation patterns suggested that these compounds represent labdane-related diterpenoids carrying one or more oxygenation functions (Fig. S4). To elucidate the precise structure of these diterpenoids, metabolites were extracted from mature Cave-in-Rock roots and purified via liquid-liquid phase partitioning followed by HPLC. Purified samples (0.4-0.8 mg for each compound) of both m/z 301 isomers and both m/z 317 diterpenoid isomers were used for 1D (1H and 13C) and 2D (HSQC, COSY, HMBC and NOESY) NMR analyses. Collectively, the generated data identified the m/z 301 diterpenoids as 15,16-epoxy-2-oxo-5alpha8alpha-cleroda-3,13(16),l4-triene and its C19 enantiomer, while the earlier eluting diterpenoid m/z 317 was identified as 2-oxo-5alpha8alpha-cleroda-3,13-dien-16,l5-olide, together designated as panicoloid A, panicoloid B, and panicoloid C respectively (Figs 8b, S6). Insufficient abundance and purity of the later eluting m/z 317 diterpenoid isomer prevented structural analysis of this metabolite. Based on the similar mass fragmentation pattern and RT compared to the other m/z 317 isomer (Fig. S4), it is plausible that this compound represents its enantiomeric isomer and is tentatively named panicoloid D. The identified diterpenoids represent derivatives of previously identified switchgrass furanoditerpenoids that feature additional carbonyl functions at C2 and/or C14 and are collectively named here as the group of panicoloids (Fig. S4)."

			"context": "Pathways of general and specialized metabolism showed overall comparatively moderate differential gene expression in response to drought stress with apparent metabolic differences between leaf and root tissue. Accumulation of sucrose and ABA in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock tissues is consistent with previously demonstrated switchgrass drought responses (Liu et al.,). In addition, the observed major contribution of phospholipids to metabolic alterations in leaves of both genotypes may be related to an upregulation of pathways involved in membrane lipid systems and cell wall biosynthesis as shown in, for example, drought-resistant maize lines (Zhang et al.,). Additional phospholipid roles in drought tolerance may include maintenance of membrane integrity or mitigation of drought-related cell damage (Hamrouni et al.,), as well as signaling processes during water deficiency as reported in selected drought-resistant species (Quartacci et al.,; Moradi et al.,). Contrasting drought-related flavonoid functions in, for example, wheat (Triticum aestivum) and other species (Ma et al.,; Gai et al.,), leaf flavonoid glycosides did not accumulate in response to drought in either switchgrass genotype, despite a moderate upregulation of select pathway genes such as CHS in drought-stressed plants. Similarly, steroidal and triterpenoid saponins were identified in switchgrass leaves, and have been shown to increase as part of the leaf cuticular waxes in response to drought (Kim et al.,). However, our metabolite analysis did not show significant drought-elicited triterpenoid accumulation that would support a similar function in switchgrass.\nConsidering that predicted specialized steroidal and triterpenoid saponins and diterpenoids contribute substantially to the metabolic differences between Alamo and Cave-in-Rock roots, we examined these compounds in more detail in leaf and root extracts after 4 wk of drought where the physiological stress symptoms were most pronounced. Several predicted flavonoid glycosides were identified in leaves of Alamo and Cave-in-Rock plants but were absent in root tissue. However, these compounds showed no or only minimal patterns of drought-elicited accumulation (Fig. 8a). In addition, a range of distinct terpenoid metabolites was identified. Among these metabolites, the largest group represented recently identified steroidal or triterpenoid saponins (Li et al.,), showing distinct profiles across tissues and genotypes. Triterpenoid saponins occurred predominantly in leaves of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock plants, whereas the larger group of steroidal saponins were present in leaves and/or roots and occurred predominantly in either Alamo or Cave-in-Rock plants. Despite the overall abundance of these saponins, the vast majority of the annotated metabolites were not significantly enriched upon drought stress (P <= 0.05; Table S6). In addition to the larger group of triterpenoids, 11 compounds predicted as specialized diterpenoids were identified, the majority of which occurred predominantly in Alamo roots and were absent or abundant at only low levels in Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 8a). Notably, two pairs of predictably isomeric diterpenoids were detected in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock that showed substantial accumulation mostly in drought-stressed roots. One metabolite pair at RTs of 9.06 min and 9.26 min featured a dominant precursor mass ion of m/z 317 [M + H]+ and one compound pair at RTs of 11.50 min and 11.72 min featured a dominant ion of m/z 317 [M + H]+. Together with the presence of additional mass ions of m/z 257, m/z 189, m/z 177 or m/z 135, these fragmentation patterns suggested that these compounds represent labdane-related diterpenoids carrying one or more oxygenation functions (Fig. S4). To elucidate the precise structure of these diterpenoids, metabolites were extracted from mature Cave-in-Rock roots and purified via liquid-liquid phase partitioning followed by HPLC. Purified samples (0.4-0.8 mg for each compound) of both m/z 301 isomers and both m/z 317 diterpenoid isomers were used for 1D (1H and 13C) and 2D (HSQC, COSY, HMBC and NOESY) NMR analyses. Collectively, the generated data identified the m/z 301 diterpenoids as 15,16-epoxy-2-oxo-5alpha8alpha-cleroda-3,13(16),l4-triene and its C19 enantiomer, while the earlier eluting diterpenoid m/z 317 was identified as 2-oxo-5alpha8alpha-cleroda-3,13-dien-16,l5-olide, together designated as panicoloid A, panicoloid B, and panicoloid C respectively (Figs 8b, S6). Insufficient abundance and purity of the later eluting m/z 317 diterpenoid isomer prevented structural analysis of this metabolite. Based on the similar mass fragmentation pattern and RT compared to the other m/z 317 isomer (Fig. S4), it is plausible that this compound represents its enantiomeric isomer and is tentatively named panicoloid D. The identified diterpenoids represent derivatives of previously identified switchgrass furanoditerpenoids that feature additional carbonyl functions at C2 and/or C14 and are collectively named here as the group of panicoloids (Fig. S4)."

Additional phospholipid roles in drought tolerance may include maintenance of membrane integrity or mitigation of drought-related cell damage (Hamrouni et al.,), as well as signaling processes during water deficiency as reported in selected drought-resistant species (Quartacci et al.,; Moradi et al.,). Contrasting drought-related flavonoid functions in, for example, wheat (Triticum aestivum) and other species (Ma et al.,; Gai et al.,), leaf flavonoid glycosides did not accumulate in response to drought in either switchgrass genotype, despite a moderate upregulation of select pathway genes such as CHS in drought-stressed plants. Similarly, steroidal and triterpenoid saponins were identified in switchgrass leaves, and have been shown to increase as part of the leaf cuticular waxes in response to drought (Kim et al.,). However, our metabolite analysis did not show significant drought-elicited triterpenoid accumulation that would support a similar function in switchgrass."

			"context": "Considering that predicted specialized steroidal and triterpenoid saponins and diterpenoids contribute substantially to the metabolic differences between Alamo and Cave-in-Rock roots, we examined these compounds in more detail in leaf and root extracts after 4 wk of drought where the physiological stress symptoms were most pronounced. Several predicted flavonoid glycosides were identified in leaves of Alamo and Cave-in-Rock plants but were absent in root tissue. However, these compounds showed no or only minimal patterns of drought-elicited accumulation (Fig. 8a). In addition, a range of distinct terpenoid metabolites was identified. Among these metabolites, the largest group represented recently identified steroidal or triterpenoid saponins (Li et al.,), showing distinct profiles across tissues and genotypes. Triterpenoid saponins occurred predominantly in leaves of both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock plants, whereas the larger group of steroidal saponins were present in leaves and/or roots and occurred predominantly in either Alamo or Cave-in-Rock plants. Despite the overall abundance of these saponins, the vast majority of the annotated metabolites were not significantly enriched upon drought stress (P <= 0.05; Table S6). In addition to the larger group of triterpenoids, 11 compounds predicted as specialized diterpenoids were identified, the majority of which occurred predominantly in Alamo roots and were absent or abundant at only low levels in Cave-in-Rock (Fig. 8a). Notably, two pairs of predictably isomeric diterpenoids were detected in Alamo and Cave-in-Rock that showed substantial accumulation mostly in drought-stressed roots. One metabolite pair at RTs of 9.06 min and 9.26 min featured a dominant precursor mass ion of m/z 317 [M + H]+ and one compound pair at RTs of 11.50 min and 11.72 min featured a dominant ion of m/z 317 [M + H]+. Together with the presence of additional mass ions of m/z 257, m/z 189, m/z 177 or m/z 135, these fragmentation patterns suggested that these compounds represent labdane-related diterpenoids carrying one or more oxygenation functions (Fig. S4). To elucidate the precise structure of these diterpenoids, metabolites were extracted from mature Cave-in-Rock roots and purified via liquid-liquid phase partitioning followed by HPLC. Purified samples (0.4-0.8 mg for each compound) of both m/z 301 isomers and both m/z 317 diterpenoid isomers were used for 1D (1H and 13C) and 2D (HSQC, COSY, HMBC and NOESY) NMR analyses. Collectively, the generated data identified the m/z 301 diterpenoids as 15,16-epoxy-2-oxo-5alpha8alpha-cleroda-3,13(16),l4-triene and its C19 enantiomer, while the earlier eluting diterpenoid m/z 317 was identified as 2-oxo-5alpha8alpha-cleroda-3,13-dien-16,l5-olide, together designated as panicoloid A, panicoloid B, and panicoloid C respectively (Figs 8b, S6). Insufficient abundance and purity of the later eluting m/z 317 diterpenoid isomer prevented structural analysis of this metabolite. Based on the similar mass fragmentation pattern and RT compared to the other m/z 317 isomer (Fig. S4), it is plausible that this compound represents its enantiomeric isomer and is tentatively named panicoloid D. The identified diterpenoids represent derivatives of previously identified switchgrass furanoditerpenoids that feature additional carbonyl functions at C2 and/or C14 and are collectively named here as the group of panicoloids (Fig. S4)."

Notably, MEP and MVA pathway genes showed no or very minor patterns of drought-inducible expression in Alamo or Cave-in-Rock, indicating that no major change in the production of terpenoid precursors occurs in response to drought. One exception is the putative GGPPS, Pavir.6NG089000, that is expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots and may contribute to differences in terpenoid metabolism between these genotypes. This apparent lack of drought activation of terpenoid backbone pathways suggests that terpenoid accumulation has to derive from existing precursor pools via changes in pathway branches en route to specific terpenoids. Indeed, in leaves and roots of Alamo, but not Cave-in-Rock, downstream triterpenoid-metabolic pathway genes increased under drought conditions. Interestingly, no apparent triterpenoid-biosynthetic gene clusters were identified in the switchgrass genome, which differentiates switchgrass from other plant species where triterpenoid metabolism is commonly arranged in form of often stress-inducible biosynthetic clusters (Liu et al.,; Bai et al.,). Despite the lack of apparent genomic clusters, clear co-expression patterns were observed for several TTS genes as well as sterol 3-beta-glucosyltransferases and P450 genes of the CYP71A, CYP94D and CYP90B families, thus supporting the presence of co-expressed pathways toward specific triterpenoids. The identification of diverse mixtures of diosgenin and closely related triterpenoid saponins in roots of several upland and lowland ecotypes, including Alamo and Cave-in-Rock, supports this hypothesis (Lee et al.,; Li et al.,). However, the annotated triterpenoid metabolites were not significantly enriched in response to drought in either genotype, suggesting that the inducible expression of triterpenoid pathways in Alamo is related to distinct drought-stress responses. It can be speculated that root triterpenoids serve antioxidant functions to mitigate oxidative damage caused by water deficiency as shown in Arabidopsis and other species (Pose et al.,; Nasrollahi et al.,; Puente-Garza et al.,). Also, recent studies have demonstrated bioactive triterpenoids in roots exudates of soybean (Glycine max) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) that aid the assembly of the root microbiome to confer robustness against environmental stresses (Fujimatsu et al.,; Nakayasu et al.,). While distinct microbiome responses to drought stress have been reported in upland and lowland switchgrass ecotypes (Liu et al.,), the role of specialized metabolites such as saponins in these interactions is yet to be discovered."

It can be speculated that root triterpenoids serve antioxidant functions to mitigate oxidative damage caused by water deficiency as shown in Arabidopsis and other species (Pose et al.,; Nasrollahi et al.,; Puente-Garza et al.,). Also, recent studies have demonstrated bioactive triterpenoids in roots exudates of soybean (Glycine max) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) that aid the assembly of the root microbiome to confer robustness against environmental stresses (Fujimatsu et al.,; Nakayasu et al.,). While distinct microbiome responses to drought stress have been reported in upland and lowland switchgrass ecotypes (Liu et al.,), the role of specialized metabolites such as saponins in these interactions is yet to be discovered."

Extensive studies in major food and bioenergy crops such as rice, maize, and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) have demonstrated that species-specific blends of specialized terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, oxylipins, and benzoxazinoids mediate complex responses to biotic and abiotic perturbations (Schmelz et al.,; Murphy & Zerbe,). By contrast, knowledge of the diversity of specialized metabolites in the perennial bioenergy crop switchgrass and its relevance for drought adaptation in different switchgrass genotypes is incomplete. Combined transcriptome and metabolome analysis of the lowland ecotype Alamo shown to be drought-tolerant and the upland ecotype Cave-in-Rock with low drought tolerance (Liu et al.,) revealed common and distinct metabolic alterations and identified specialized diterpenoid metabolites with possible functions in switchgrass drought adaptation."

Despite the lack of apparent genomic clusters, clear co-expression patterns were observed for several TTS genes as well as sterol 3-beta-glucosyltransferases and P450 genes of the CYP71A, CYP94D and CYP90B families, thus supporting the presence of co-expressed pathways toward specific triterpenoids. The identification of diverse mixtures of diosgenin and closely related triterpenoid saponins in roots of several upland and lowland ecotypes, including Alamo and Cave-in-Rock, supports this hypothesis (Lee et al.,; Li et al.,). However, the annotated triterpenoid metabolites were not significantly enriched in response to drought in either genotype, suggesting that the inducible expression of triterpenoid pathways in Alamo is related to distinct drought-stress responses. It can be speculated that root triterpenoids serve antioxidant functions to mitigate oxidative damage caused by water deficiency as shown in Arabidopsis and other species (Pose et al.,; Nasrollahi et al.,; Puente-Garza et al.,). Also, recent studies have demonstrated bioactive triterpenoids in roots exudates of soybean (Glycine max) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) that aid the assembly of the root microbiome to confer robustness against environmental stresses (Fujimatsu et al.,; Nakayasu et al.,). While distinct microbiome responses to drought stress have been reported in upland and lowland switchgrass ecotypes (Liu et al.,), the role of specialized metabolites such as saponins in these interactions is yet to be discovered."

One exception is the putative GGPPS, Pavir.6NG089000, that is expressed in Alamo but not Cave-in-Rock roots and may contribute to differences in terpenoid metabolism between these genotypes. This apparent lack of drought activation of terpenoid backbone pathways suggests that terpenoid accumulation has to derive from existing precursor pools via changes in pathway branches en route to specific terpenoids. Indeed, in leaves and roots of Alamo, but not Cave-in-Rock, downstream triterpenoid-metabolic pathway genes increased under drought conditions. Interestingly, no apparent triterpenoid-biosynthetic gene clusters were identified in the switchgrass genome, which differentiates switchgrass from other plant species where triterpenoid metabolism is commonly arranged in form of often stress-inducible biosynthetic clusters (Liu et al.,; Bai et al.,). Despite the lack of apparent genomic clusters, clear co-expression patterns were observed for several TTS genes as well as sterol 3-beta-glucosyltransferases and P450 genes of the CYP71A, CYP94D and CYP90B families, thus supporting the presence of co-expressed pathways toward specific triterpenoids. The identification of diverse mixtures of diosgenin and closely related triterpenoid saponins in roots of several upland and lowland ecotypes, including Alamo and Cave-in-Rock, supports this hypothesis (Lee et al.,; Li et al.,). However, the annotated triterpenoid metabolites were not significantly enriched in response to drought in either genotype, suggesting that the inducible expression of triterpenoid pathways in Alamo is related to distinct drought-stress responses. It can be speculated that root triterpenoids serve antioxidant functions to mitigate oxidative damage caused by water deficiency as shown in Arabidopsis and other species (Pose et al.,; Nasrollahi et al.,; Puente-Garza et al.,). Also, recent studies have demonstrated bioactive triterpenoids in roots exudates of soybean (Glycine max) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) that aid the assembly of the root microbiome to confer robustness against environmental stresses (Fujimatsu et al.,; Nakayasu et al.,). While distinct microbiome responses to drought stress have been reported in upland and lowland switchgrass ecotypes (Liu et al.,), the role of specialized metabolites such as saponins in these interactions is yet to be discovered."

In addition, accumulation in both Alamo and Cave-in-Rock support a role of these metabolites in drought responses rather than general stress responses associated with the more pronounced wilting phenotype observed in Cave-in-Rock. Structural analysis identified three compounds as oxygenated clerodane furanoditerpenoids, named here panicoloid A-C, which likely represent derivatives of furanoditerpenoid scaffolds recently identified in switchgrass (Pelot et al.,; Muchlinski et al.,). Notably, the enantiomeric stereochemistry of panicoloid B and panicoloid C is likely derived from the activity of yet unidentified diTPS functionally related to the CLPP synthase PvCPS1. Drought-induced gene expression increases of characterized pathway genes toward clerodane-type furanoditerpenoids, including the diTPS PvCPS1 and the P450 genes CYP71Z25, CYP71Z26 and CYP71Z28 supports a role of these pathway genes in panicoloid biosynthesis. Additional co-expression of select P450s of the CYP99 family and predicted short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases/reductases, shown to function in specialized diterpenoid metabolism in maize and rice (Swaminathan et al.,), suggests possible functions in the position-specific oxygenation reactions toward panicoloid biosynthesis. Similar to triterpenoid metabolism, the lack of co-expression of these genes in the drought-susceptible Cave-in-Rock genotype may support a role of panicoloids in switchgrass drought responses. Combined with the abundance of yet unidentified diterpenoids in switchgrass roots, drought-elicited co-expression patterns of additional predicted syn-CPP synthase genes (PvCPS9, PvCPS10) and characterized class I diTPS forming syn-pimarane diterpenoids (PvKSL4, PvKSL5) suggest the presence of a broader diversity of drought-induced diterpenoids in switchgrass. Similar clerodane-type furanoditerpenoids have also been identified in species of Vellozia spec. (Pinto et al.,), Solidago spec.

While the drought-induced expression of diterpenoid-metabolic genes and associated accumulation of panicoloids and possibly other diterpenoids supports a role in switchgrass drought tolerance, the underlying mechanisms will require future investigation. However, drought-related diterpenoid bioactivities have recently been supported in other monocots. For example, maize studies demonstrated the accumulation of specialized kauralexin and dolabralexin diterpenoids in response to oxidative, drought and salinity stress (Christensen et al.,; Mafu et al.,), and diterpenoid-deficient maize mutants show decreased resilience to abiotic stress (Vaughan et al.,). Additionally, antioxidative functions in relation to drought stress have been shown for select diterpenoids (Munne-Bosch & Alegre,), and diterpenoid roles in the root microbiome assembly have been suggested based on changes in the microbiome composition in the kauralexin- and dolabralexin-deficient maize an2 mutant (Murphy et al.,)."

Additionally, antioxidative functions in relation to drought stress have been shown for select diterpenoids (Munne-Bosch & Alegre,), and diterpenoid roles in the root microbiome assembly have been suggested based on changes in the microbiome composition in the kauralexin- and dolabralexin-deficient maize an2 mutant (Murphy et al.,)."
