			"context": "Gibberellic acids (GAs) are plant hormones with a wide range of developmental activities, including plant elongation. GA-deficient plants were significantly shorter than the WT, but their height was restored to WT levels by applying GA3. Recent progress has been made in identifying genes involved in GA metabolism and signaling pathways. GA biosynthesis involves a series of pathways in which metabolic enzymes interact. Copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), a terpene cyclase, catalyzes the first specific step of the GA biosynthesis pathway to produce ent-kaurene oxidase. Morphology of CPS overexpressing-transgenic rice show similar to the WT, despite increased expression of the ent-kaurene gene. Within the GA biosynthesis pathway, dioxygenases are important for providing GA for various developmental processes, and the total biosynthesis of bioactive GA is ultimately controlled by the dioxygenases GA3ox and GA20ox. Different expression patterns of GA20ox contribute to phenotypic variation in Arabidopsis, with GA20ox overexpression increasing the production of bioactive GAs, which influence plant growth. In rice, meanwhile, functionally deficient mutants of GA20ox show a typical dwarf phenotype."

We therefore analyzed OsGASD expression in response to GA, finding that it increased in shoots (but not roots) in response to GA treatment ( Figure 2 ,  S2 ). In addition, plant height and the lengths of panicles and internodes in the osgasd Ko mutant were restored to WT levels in response to GA treatment ( Figures 2B-F ). Furthermore, the shoots of OsGASD Ox plants had higher GA3 contents than WT shoots, whereas the shoots of the osgasd Ko mutant had lower GA3 content than WT shoots. However, GA3 contents in the roots of both OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko plants were similar to those of WT plants ( Figures 3A, B ). These results suggest that OsGASD is involved in GA biosynthesis in rice shoots. In Arabidopsis, both AtCPS- and AtCPS/AtKS-overexpressing transgenic plants showed increased accumulation of ent-kaurene and ent-kaurenoic acid, two early intermediates in the GA biosynthetic pathway, but normal levels of bioactive GA. Here, we analyzed the expression of key genes involved in GA biosynthesis, such CPS, KS, KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2. Whereas KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2 were upregulated in the shoots of young OsGASD Ox plants, the expression of CPS and KS was not significantly altered ( Figure 3C ). These results indicate that OsGASD mediates the accumulation of bioactive GA in young shoots during development.\nAnalysis of GA3 concentrations and GA biosynthesis genes expression in osgasd knockout mutant and OsGASD-overexpressing transgenic plants. (A, B) GA3 concentrations were measured in the shoots (A) and roots (B) of Ko, Ox and WT plants grown on MS media for 30 days. (C) RT-qPCR analysis shows changes in transcriptional expression levels in shoot of Ko, Ox and WT plants. CPS, Copalyl diphosphate synthase; KS, ent-kaurene synthase; KO, ent- kaurene oxidase; KAO, ent- kaurenoic acid hydroxylase; GA20, GA 20 oxidase; GA2, GA 2 oxidase. Error bars indicate SD.

We analyzed the sensitivity of these mutants and WT to GA treatment ( Figure S3  and  Figures 2C-F ). In response to GA spray treatment, 5-weeks-old osgasd Ko mutants increase of plant height compared to the WT ( Figures S3A, B ). The plant height of 14-week-old osgasd Ko mutants increased with increasing GA3 concentration, with the height of the osgasd Ko plants treated with 10 ppm GA3 being restored to level similar to those of WT plants ( Figures 2C, D ). We also analyzed internode elongation, panicle length, and tiller number in the osgasd Ko mutant ( Figures 2E, F ). With increasing GA3 concentration, the lengths of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth internodes in the mutant increased, while the panicle length was not significantly altered, and the tiller number decreased. These results, together with the expression pattern of OsGASD and the GA sensitivity of the osgasd Ko mutant, suggest that OsGASD function is related to GA biosynthesis during plant growth.\nAnalysis of OsGASD expression and effect of osgasd knockout mutant morphology in response to GA. (A) RT-qPCR analysis shows expression patterns of OsGASD in shoot and root. (B) The transcript level of OsGASD is shown in response to GA. Ten-day-old wild-type seedlings (Dongjin) were treated with 100 microM GA3 for 15min. Control plants were not treated with GA (Con). Error bars indicate SD. OsActin1 (Os03g0718100) was used as an internal control and relative expression levels are shown in fold values. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between the corresponding samples and their control (p-value<0.1, Student's t-test). (C-F) Growth of osgasd knockout mutant grown on green house. (C and D) At the panicle heading stage (14 weeks) of osgasd knockout mutant treated with the indicated concentration of GA for 1, 10, 20 mg/L (ppm) (C) GA3 solution were sprayed with distilled water as control. Scale bar=15cm (D) Plant height measured seven days later for analysis. (E, F) P and PL indicated the panicle and panicle length. I to V indicated the corresponding internodes from top to bottom. Scale bar=10cm (E). Quantification of plant height (D), panicle and internodes length, and tiller number (F) in osgasd knockout mutant treated with GA (n>20). WT plants did not treat with GA.

GA-deficient plants were significantly shorter than the WT, but their height was restored to WT levels by applying GA3. Recent progress has been made in identifying genes involved in GA metabolism and signaling pathways. GA biosynthesis involves a series of pathways in which metabolic enzymes interact. Copalyl diphosphate synthase (CPS), a terpene cyclase, catalyzes the first specific step of the GA biosynthesis pathway to produce ent-kaurene oxidase. Morphology of CPS overexpressing-transgenic rice show similar to the WT, despite increased expression of the ent-kaurene gene. Within the GA biosynthesis pathway, dioxygenases are important for providing GA for various developmental processes, and the total biosynthesis of bioactive GA is ultimately controlled by the dioxygenases GA3ox and GA20ox. Different expression patterns of GA20ox contribute to phenotypic variation in Arabidopsis, with GA20ox overexpression increasing the production of bioactive GAs, which influence plant growth. In rice, meanwhile, functionally deficient mutants of GA20ox show a typical dwarf phenotype."

By analyzing these mutants, we identified a novel gene encoding the ARPC2 subunit, which we named gibberellic acid sensitive dwarf (GASD). To investigate the role of OsGASD in plant development, we performed phenotypic and transcriptomic analysis of OsGASD-overexpressing (Ox) and OsGASD knockout (Ko) plants. Based on our findings, we propose that OsGASD is involved in the GA biosynthetic pathway and plays important roles in regulating plant growth and productivity. Our findings also shed light on the interactions between ARP genes and GAs."

Analysis of the morphology of whole plants, internodes, panicles, and grains from OsGASD Ox, osgasd Ko mutant, and WT plants revealed that OsGASD Ox showed increased plant and grain size, including increased plant height, internode length, panicle number, and grain weight, whereas the osgasd Ko mutants exhibited reduced plant and grain size ( Figures 4A-F, L ;  Table S1 ). To further explore rice productivity, we analyzed agronomic traits including the number of panicles, filling rate, number of spikelets per panicle, total grain weight, and 1,000-grain weight ( Figures 4G-K ;  Table S1 ). The number of panicles was approximately 40% lower in the osgasd Ko mutants compared to the WT plants. However, the number of panicles was not significantly elevated in OsGASD Ox plants. Total grain weight, the number of filled grains, and 1,000-grain weight of OsGASD Ox plants increased by approximately 27%, 30% and 13%, respectively, compared to WT plants. However, the filling rate was reduced in OsGASD Ox plants compared to WT plants. By contrast, the osgasd Ko mutants showed reduced values for all parameters compared to WT plants. Consequently, the total grain weight and total number of filled grains were higher in OsGASD Ox plants, but lower in osgasd Ko plants, compared to WT plants. Furthermore, the seed size and 1,000-grain weight differed among lines ( Figures 4K, L ). These results suggest that the increased grain yield in OsGASD Ox is largely due to increases in panicle length, number of filled grains, and grain weight, supporting the notion that the expression of OsGASD affects the development of seeds that form in the panicle."

OsGASD shared approximately 15-35% sequence identity with its homologs from Arabidopsis [Arabidopsis thaliana], cattle [Bos taurus], fruit fly [Drosophila melanogaster], nematode [Caenorhabditis elegans], and yeast [Saccharomyces cerevisiae]). AtARPC2B and OsARPC2B share C-terminal amino acids representing a conserved domain of ARPC2Bs. The subcellular localizations of ARPs are in the nucleus to perform their specific function. We investigated the subcellular localization of fluorescent protein-tagged OsGASD and DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) that is nuclear staining dye using a rice protoplast transient expression system ( Figure S2 ). OsGASD co-localized with DAPI. This indicates that OsGASD is nucleus localizing proteins. These results indicate that OsGASD encodes a ARPC2B protein that is involved in plant development."

We therefore analyzed OsGASD expression in response to GA, finding that it increased in shoots (but not roots) in response to GA treatment ( Figure 2 ,  S2 ). In addition, plant height and the lengths of panicles and internodes in the osgasd Ko mutant were restored to WT levels in response to GA treatment ( Figures 2B-F ). Furthermore, the shoots of OsGASD Ox plants had higher GA3 contents than WT shoots, whereas the shoots of the osgasd Ko mutant had lower GA3 content than WT shoots. However, GA3 contents in the roots of both OsGASD Ox and osgasd Ko plants were similar to those of WT plants ( Figures 3A, B ). These results suggest that OsGASD is involved in GA biosynthesis in rice shoots. In Arabidopsis, both AtCPS- and AtCPS/AtKS-overexpressing transgenic plants showed increased accumulation of ent-kaurene and ent-kaurenoic acid, two early intermediates in the GA biosynthetic pathway, but normal levels of bioactive GA. Here, we analyzed the expression of key genes involved in GA biosynthesis, such CPS, KS, KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2. Whereas KO, KAO, GA20, and GA2 were upregulated in the shoots of young OsGASD Ox plants, the expression of CPS and KS was not significantly altered ( Figure 3C ). These results indicate that OsGASD mediates the accumulation of bioactive GA in young shoots during development."

KAO, GA20 and GA2 transcript levels were higher in OsGASD Ox plants than in WT plants. By contrast, KAO, GA20 and GA2 transcript levels were lower in osgasd Ko than in WT plants. These results point to an association between OsGASD expression and GA biosynthesis in plants."
