(a) A representative leaf is shown from the agroinfiltration of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes from Macarthuria australis (MaDODA\nalpha), Telephium imperati (TiDODA\nalpha), Polycarpon tetraphyllum (PtDODA\nalpha), Cardionema ramosissimum (CrDODA\nalpha), Spergularia marina (SmDODA\nalpha), Limeum aethiopicum (LaDODA\nalpha) and Kewa caespitosa (KcDODA\nalpha\n1, KcDODA\nalpha\n2). The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs with the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector was included as a positive control (P). (b) Betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC. Amounts of betanin were calculated relative (RQ) to the average amount of betanin present in BvDODAalpha1 infiltration spots for each species and the data combined into one graph (see Supporting Information Fig. S12 for species-specific data). Bars show means +- SD; n >= 3. (c) A representative HPLC trace for each DODA\nalpha gene from each species is shown. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl, which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples.\nBetalain-pigmented species have a single DODA that has high activity when heterologously expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana and other DODA that have no or marginal activity. (a) A representative leaf is shown from the agroinfiltration of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes from Stegnosperma halimifolium, Beta vulgaris, Carnegiea gigantea and Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs containing the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The infiltration spots are labelled according to the DODA variant. For all species, the pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector is included as a positive control (P). (b) The betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC and data were represented relative to the BvDODAalpha1 spot present in each biological replicate. The data were combined after calculating relative amounts (RQ) for each species from individual species-specific experiments (Supporting Information Figs S8-S11). Bars show means +- SD; n = 5 for S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, C. gigantea and M. crystallinum, except for BvDODAalpha2 (n = 4) and BvDODAalpha3 (n = 4). (c) A representative HPLC trace for the DODA\nalpha\n1 gene from each species. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples."

(a) A representative leaf is shown from the agroinfiltration of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes from Macarthuria australis (MaDODA\nalpha), Telephium imperati (TiDODA\nalpha), Polycarpon tetraphyllum (PtDODA\nalpha), Cardionema ramosissimum (CrDODA\nalpha), Spergularia marina (SmDODA\nalpha), Limeum aethiopicum (LaDODA\nalpha) and Kewa caespitosa (KcDODA\nalpha\n1, KcDODA\nalpha\n2). The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs with the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector was included as a positive control (P). (b) Betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC. Amounts of betanin were calculated relative (RQ) to the average amount of betanin present in BvDODAalpha1 infiltration spots for each species and the data combined into one graph (see Supporting Information Fig. S12 for species-specific data). Bars show means +- SD; n >= 3. (c) A representative HPLC trace for each DODA\nalpha gene from each species is shown. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl, which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples.\nBetalain-pigmented species have a single DODA that has high activity when heterologously expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana and other DODA that have no or marginal activity. (a) A representative leaf is shown from the agroinfiltration of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes from Stegnosperma halimifolium, Beta vulgaris, Carnegiea gigantea and Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs containing the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The infiltration spots are labelled according to the DODA variant. For all species, the pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector is included as a positive control (P). (b) The betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC and data were represented relative to the BvDODAalpha1 spot present in each biological replicate. The data were combined after calculating relative amounts (RQ) for each species from individual species-specific experiments (Supporting Information Figs S8-S11). Bars show means +- SD; n = 5 for S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, C. gigantea and M. crystallinum, except for BvDODAalpha2 (n = 4) and BvDODAalpha3 (n = 4). (c) A representative HPLC trace for the DODA\nalpha\n1 gene from each species. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples."

(2018) across functionally characterised high activity (left) and no or only marginal activity (right) paralogues included in this study. 1: ShDODAalpha1 vs ShDODAalpha2 (Stegnospermataceae); 2: CqDODA-1, BvDODAalpha1 vs PhybDODAalpha, BvDODAalpha2-5 (Amaranthaceae); 3: McDODAalpha1, PmDODAalpha1, CgDODAalpha1, PgDODAalpha1 vs McDODAalpha2, PmDODAalpha2, CgDODAalpha2 (Portulacineae and Aizoaceae). Residue numbering is according to Bean et al. (2018). (b) Ancestral sequence reconstructions of codons by empirical Bayesian inference on a maximum likelihood phylogeny of a reduced DODA\nalpha sequence alignment. Logo plots at tips give the proportional representation of a given amino acid across all sequences in each collapsed clade for each of the sites identified by Bean et al. (2018). Numbers at nodes match the ancestor of the high-activity paralogues summarised in (a)."

(a) A representative leaf is shown from the agroinfiltration of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes from Macarthuria australis (MaDODA\nalpha), Telephium imperati (TiDODA\nalpha), Polycarpon tetraphyllum (PtDODA\nalpha), Cardionema ramosissimum (CrDODA\nalpha), Spergularia marina (SmDODA\nalpha), Limeum aethiopicum (LaDODA\nalpha) and Kewa caespitosa (KcDODA\nalpha\n1, KcDODA\nalpha\n2). The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs with the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector was included as a positive control (P). (b) Betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC. Amounts of betanin were calculated relative (RQ) to the average amount of betanin present in BvDODAalpha1 infiltration spots for each species and the data combined into one graph (see Supporting Information Fig. S12 for species-specific data). Bars show means +- SD; n >= 3. (c) A representative HPLC trace for each DODA\nalpha gene from each species is shown. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl, which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples."

The B. vulgaris locus with high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity falls within this operon, while the paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity occur outside of the gene cluster, supporting the concept of a betalain gene cluster in B. vulgaris. Our analysis, which describes the relative synteny of homologous loci between genomes, also shows that the betalain gene cluster appears to be conserved in the genomes of C. quinoa and A. hypochondriacus (Fig. 5). These divergent species all belong to the family Amaranthaceae and represent one putative origin of betalain pigmentation (Fig. 2, origin no. 2). However, CYP76AD1 and DODAalpha1 are not clustered in the genome of M. crystallinum, which represents a different putative origin (Fig. 2, origin no. 3). Therefore, the absence of colocalisation in M. crystallinum highlights interesting structural genomic differences among putative betalain origins."

(2018) across functionally characterised high activity (left) and no or only marginal activity (right) paralogues included in this study. 1: ShDODAalpha1 vs ShDODAalpha2 (Stegnospermataceae); 2: CqDODA-1, BvDODAalpha1 vs PhybDODAalpha, BvDODAalpha2-5 (Amaranthaceae); 3: McDODAalpha1, PmDODAalpha1, CgDODAalpha1, PgDODAalpha1 vs McDODAalpha2, PmDODAalpha2, CgDODAalpha2 (Portulacineae and Aizoaceae). Residue numbering is according to Bean et al. (2018). (b) Ancestral sequence reconstructions of codons by empirical Bayesian inference on a maximum likelihood phylogeny of a reduced DODA\nalpha sequence alignment. Logo plots at tips give the proportional representation of a given amino acid across all sequences in each collapsed clade for each of the sites identified by Bean et al. (2018). Numbers at nodes match the ancestor of the high-activity paralogues summarised in (a)."

      "context": "To explore the hypothesis of multiple origins of betalain pigmentation suggested by our reconstructions, we then selected four species that represent each of the putative origins: S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea. Using heterologous transient assays, we inferred relative levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity based on the proxy of betanin production (Fig. 3). Our data show that activity is barely detectable in DODAbeta loci from betalain-pigmented species, supporting our original hypothesis that the high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity evolved exclusively within the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). However, although betalain-pigmented species have multiple paralogues of DODAalpha genes, only one of these DODAalpha in each species encodes a protein which exhibits high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. All betalain-pigmented species also exhibit DODAalpha paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and we also detected marginal activity in several anthocyanic taxa (Fig. 4). Thus, marginal activity is widespread among Caryophyllales DODAalpha enzymes, suggesting broader underlying catalytic promiscuity in the DODAalpha lineage. Catalytic promiscuity is well documented in the broader protocatechuate dioxygenase gene family of which the LigB/DODA lineage is a member (Burroughs et al., 2019). Such promiscuity is an important feature of metabolic evolution, potentially conferring evolvability (Weng & Noel, 2012; Leong & Last, 2017), and may have significant implications for the recurrent evolution of betalain pigmentation, as discussed below."

The arogenate dehydrogenase enzyme (ADHalpha) responsible for increased tyrosine availability is also lost and/or down-regulated in the anthocyanic Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae lineages (Lopez-Nieves et al., 2018). Therefore, the shift to anthocyanins in these taxa may indicate deeper shifts away from a tyrosine-rich metabolism towards a metabolism in which phenylalanine plays a canonical role. The primary function of the DODAalpha paralogues with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity is unknown, but may catalyse production of tyrosine-derived metabolites, other than betalains. In this scenario, the duplication that gave rise to the DODAbeta and DODAalpha lineages led to neofunctionalisation in the DODAalpha lineage towards an unknown but tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Loss of DODA alpha in Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae could instead reflect loss of the unknown tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, in the context of shifts towards more phenylalanine-biased metabolism, independent of origins of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity."

The maximum likelihood phylogeny of Caryophyllales l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes was inferred from coding sequences derived from genomes and transcriptomes. Branch lengths are expected number of substitutions per site. Scale bar gives 0.2 expected substitutions per site. Branch labels are support values for major paralogous clades from rapid bootstrapping and the SH-like Approximate Likelihood Ratio Test, respectively, given as RBS/SH-aLRT. Putative major duplication nodes are highlighted with stars. Branches are coloured according to the putative pigmentation state of the taxa (blue, anthocyanin; pink, betalain). Labelled tips show functionally characterised DODAs and shaded squares correspond to DODA activity (white, no activity; grey, marginal activity; black, high activity). Asterisks indicate putative pseudogenes. Annotated at tips is a colour-coded alignment of the seven residues conferring high activity reported in Bean et al. (2018).

      "context": "However, evolutionary patterns within the DODAalpha lineage are complex (Brockington et al., 2015). In addition to the DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, there have been at least nine duplications in the DODAalpha lineage resulting in all betalain-pigmented lineages of Caryophyllales containing at least three DODA genes - at least one homologue from the DODAbeta lineage and at least two paralogues from the DODAalpha lineage, with Beta vulgaris containing five copies of DODA alpha. In B. vulgaris, only two DODAalpha paralogues have been studied (Sasaki et al., 2009; Gandia-Herrero & Garcia-Carmona, 2012; Hatlestad et al., 2012; Chung et al., 2015; Bean et al., 2018), with one paralogue, BvDODA1 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha1), found to exhibit high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the other paralogue, BvDODA2 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha2), exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Bean et al. (2018) compared BvDODAalpha1 and BvDODAalpha2 and identified seven divergent residues that, when altered in BvDODAalpha2, were sufficient to allow BvDODAalpha2 to convert l-DOPA to betalamic acid in yeast. Like BvDODAalpha2, two DODAalpha paralogues from other species (Parakeelya mirabilis and a Ptilotus hybrid) have also been shown to have limited or no capacity to produce betalamic acid (Chung et al., 2015). Extensive gene duplication within the DODAalpha lineage and the conserved presence of paralogues exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity suggests further sub- and/or neofunctionalisation events occurring within the DODAalpha clade, although the evolutionary significance of this is unclear.\nThe DODA gene tree shows a homoplasious distribution of functionally characterised DODA genes that produce a high level of betalain pigments. The maximum likelihood phylogeny of Caryophyllales l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes was inferred from coding sequences derived from genomes and transcriptomes. Branch lengths are expected number of substitutions per site. Scale bar gives 0.2 expected substitutions per site. Branch labels are support values for major paralogous clades from rapid bootstrapping and the SH-like Approximate Likelihood Ratio Test, respectively, given as RBS/SH-aLRT. Putative major duplication nodes are highlighted with stars. Branches are coloured according to the putative pigmentation state of the taxa (blue, anthocyanin; pink, betalain). Labelled tips show functionally characterised DODAs and shaded squares correspond to DODA activity (white, no activity; grey, marginal activity; black, high activity). Asterisks indicate putative pseudogenes. Annotated at tips is a colour-coded alignment of the seven residues conferring high activity reported in Bean et al. (2018).

The B. vulgaris locus with high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity falls within this operon, while the paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity occur outside of the gene cluster, supporting the concept of a betalain gene cluster in B. vulgaris. Our analysis, which describes the relative synteny of homologous loci between genomes, also shows that the betalain gene cluster appears to be conserved in the genomes of C. quinoa and A. hypochondriacus (Fig. 5). These divergent species all belong to the family Amaranthaceae and represent one putative origin of betalain pigmentation (Fig. 2, origin no. 2). However, CYP76AD1 and DODAalpha1 are not clustered in the genome of M. crystallinum, which represents a different putative origin (Fig. 2, origin no. 3). Therefore, the absence of colocalisation in M. crystallinum highlights interesting structural genomic differences among putative betalain origins."

The B. vulgaris locus with high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity falls within this operon, while the paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity occur outside of the gene cluster, supporting the concept of a betalain gene cluster in B. vulgaris. Our analysis, which describes the relative synteny of homologous loci between genomes, also shows that the betalain gene cluster appears to be conserved in the genomes of C. quinoa and A. hypochondriacus (Fig. 5). These divergent species all belong to the family Amaranthaceae and represent one putative origin of betalain pigmentation (Fig. 2, origin no. 2). However, CYP76AD1 and DODAalpha1 are not clustered in the genome of M. crystallinum, which represents a different putative origin (Fig. 2, origin no. 3). Therefore, the absence of colocalisation in M. crystallinum highlights interesting structural genomic differences among putative betalain origins."

The maximum likelihood phylogeny of Caryophyllales l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes was inferred from coding sequences derived from genomes and transcriptomes. Branch lengths are expected number of substitutions per site. Scale bar gives 0.2 expected substitutions per site. Branch labels are support values for major paralogous clades from rapid bootstrapping and the SH-like Approximate Likelihood Ratio Test, respectively, given as RBS/SH-aLRT. Putative major duplication nodes are highlighted with stars. Branches are coloured according to the putative pigmentation state of the taxa (blue, anthocyanin; pink, betalain). Labelled tips show functionally characterised DODAs and shaded squares correspond to DODA activity (white, no activity; grey, marginal activity; black, high activity). Asterisks indicate putative pseudogenes. Annotated at tips is a colour-coded alignment of the seven residues conferring high activity reported in Bean et al. (2018).

The maximum likelihood phylogeny of Caryophyllales l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes was inferred from coding sequences derived from genomes and transcriptomes. Branch lengths are expected number of substitutions per site. Scale bar gives 0.2 expected substitutions per site. Branch labels are support values for major paralogous clades from rapid bootstrapping and the SH-like Approximate Likelihood Ratio Test, respectively, given as RBS/SH-aLRT. Putative major duplication nodes are highlighted with stars. Branches are coloured according to the putative pigmentation state of the taxa (blue, anthocyanin; pink, betalain). Labelled tips show functionally characterised DODAs and shaded squares correspond to DODA activity (white, no activity; grey, marginal activity; black, high activity). Asterisks indicate putative pseudogenes. Annotated at tips is a colour-coded alignment of the seven residues conferring high activity reported in Bean et al. (2018).

C. Yim, unpublished) and C. gigantea (Cactaceae; Copetti et al., 2017). S. halimifolium, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea each contain one DODAbeta and two DODA alpha genes, and B. vulgaris contains one DODAbeta and five DODA alpha genes (Figs S5, S6). The DODA genes for all four species were separately cloned into multigene vectors containing all necessary genes for betalain biosynthesis and these vectors were transiently transformed into N. benthamiana to test their heterologous expression (Fig. S1; Timoneda et al., 2018). We used the production of betacyanin in this heterologous assay as a proxy for l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, with the relative strength of betacyanin production indicating the relative strength of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity between loci. Upon heterologous expression, none of the DODAbeta genes from S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea produced visible betacyanin pigmentation (Fig. 3a; Timoneda et al., 2018). Traces of betanin were detected for all loci by HPLC, but amounts were extremely low compared to the positive control, BvDODAalpha1 (< 0.1%; Fig. 3b)."

(a) A representative leaf is shown from the agroinfiltration of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes from Macarthuria australis (MaDODA\nalpha), Telephium imperati (TiDODA\nalpha), Polycarpon tetraphyllum (PtDODA\nalpha), Cardionema ramosissimum (CrDODA\nalpha), Spergularia marina (SmDODA\nalpha), Limeum aethiopicum (LaDODA\nalpha) and Kewa caespitosa (KcDODA\nalpha\n1, KcDODA\nalpha\n2). The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs with the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector was included as a positive control (P). (b) Betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC. Amounts of betanin were calculated relative (RQ) to the average amount of betanin present in BvDODAalpha1 infiltration spots for each species and the data combined into one graph (see Supporting Information Fig. S12 for species-specific data). Bars show means +- SD; n >= 3. (c) A representative HPLC trace for each DODA\nalpha gene from each species is shown. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl, which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples."

The B. vulgaris locus with high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity falls within this operon, while the paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity occur outside of the gene cluster, supporting the concept of a betalain gene cluster in B. vulgaris. Our analysis, which describes the relative synteny of homologous loci between genomes, also shows that the betalain gene cluster appears to be conserved in the genomes of C. quinoa and A. hypochondriacus (Fig. 5). These divergent species all belong to the family Amaranthaceae and represent one putative origin of betalain pigmentation (Fig. 2, origin no. 2). However, CYP76AD1 and DODAalpha1 are not clustered in the genome of M. crystallinum, which represents a different putative origin (Fig. 2, origin no. 3). Therefore, the absence of colocalisation in M. crystallinum highlights interesting structural genomic differences among putative betalain origins."

The B. vulgaris locus with high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity falls within this operon, while the paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity occur outside of the gene cluster, supporting the concept of a betalain gene cluster in B. vulgaris. Our analysis, which describes the relative synteny of homologous loci between genomes, also shows that the betalain gene cluster appears to be conserved in the genomes of C. quinoa and A. hypochondriacus (Fig. 5). These divergent species all belong to the family Amaranthaceae and represent one putative origin of betalain pigmentation (Fig. 2, origin no. 2). However, CYP76AD1 and DODAalpha1 are not clustered in the genome of M. crystallinum, which represents a different putative origin (Fig. 2, origin no. 3). Therefore, the absence of colocalisation in M. crystallinum highlights interesting structural genomic differences among putative betalain origins."

(a) A representative leaf is shown from the agroinfiltration of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes from Stegnosperma halimifolium, Beta vulgaris, Carnegiea gigantea and Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs containing the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The infiltration spots are labelled according to the DODA variant. For all species, the pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector is included as a positive control (P). (b) The betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC and data were represented relative to the BvDODAalpha1 spot present in each biological replicate. The data were combined after calculating relative amounts (RQ) for each species from individual species-specific experiments (Supporting Information Figs S8-S11). Bars show means +- SD; n = 5 for S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, C. gigantea and M. crystallinum, except for BvDODAalpha2 (n = 4) and BvDODAalpha3 (n = 4). (c) A representative HPLC trace for the DODA\nalpha\n1 gene from each species. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples."

The B. vulgaris locus with high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity falls within this operon, while the paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity occur outside of the gene cluster, supporting the concept of a betalain gene cluster in B. vulgaris. Our analysis, which describes the relative synteny of homologous loci between genomes, also shows that the betalain gene cluster appears to be conserved in the genomes of C. quinoa and A. hypochondriacus (Fig. 5). These divergent species all belong to the family Amaranthaceae and represent one putative origin of betalain pigmentation (Fig. 2, origin no. 2). However, CYP76AD1 and DODAalpha1 are not clustered in the genome of M. crystallinum, which represents a different putative origin (Fig. 2, origin no. 3). Therefore, the absence of colocalisation in M. crystallinum highlights interesting structural genomic differences among putative betalain origins."

      "context": "It has always been striking that each major betalain-pigmentated clade is subtended at, or towards, its base by an anthocyanic lineage (Brockington et al., 2011). Given this essential pattern, our trait reconstructions suggest multiple origins of betalain pigmentation. In turn, this implies that many lineages are anthocyanic through retention of an ancestral state, rather than through reversal from betalain pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2011; Fig. 2). Yet, we earlier reported that DODA alpha are lost or down-regulated in anthocyanic Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae, and previously argued that loss of DODA alpha in these anthocyanic lineages is consistent with reversals from betalain pigmentation to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015). However, the emerging picture is more complex, and with new data presented here, we find: evidence of DODA alpha loci in all but one of the anthocyanic lineages in Caryophyllales; evidence of DODA alpha gene loss in Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae, but no evidence of DODA alpha gene loss in the anthocyanin-pigmented lineages, K. caespitosa, M. australis and L. aethiopicum; and evidence of DODA alpha loci with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity within anthocyanic M. australis, K. caespitosa, C. ramosissimum and T. imperati. Clearly, evolutionarily disparate anthocyanic lineages show different patterns of molecular evolution with respect to DODA alpha. Given this complex evolutionary milieu, and in the face of compelling evidence for polyphyletic origins of elevated l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, below we propose two alternative hypotheses to explain loss of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages.\nThe DODA gene tree shows a homoplasious distribution of functionally characterised DODA genes that produce a high level of betalain pigments. The maximum likelihood phylogeny of Caryophyllales l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes was inferred from coding sequences derived from genomes and transcriptomes. Branch lengths are expected number of substitutions per site. Scale bar gives 0.2 expected substitutions per site. Branch labels are support values for major paralogous clades from rapid bootstrapping and the SH-like Approximate Likelihood Ratio Test, respectively, given as RBS/SH-aLRT. Putative major duplication nodes are highlighted with stars. Branches are coloured according to the putative pigmentation state of the taxa (blue, anthocyanin; pink, betalain). Labelled tips show functionally characterised DODAs and shaded squares correspond to DODA activity (white, no activity; grey, marginal activity; black, high activity). Asterisks indicate putative pseudogenes. Annotated at tips is a colour-coded alignment of the seven residues conferring high activity reported in Bean et al. (2018).

(2018) speculated that the evolution of tyrosine-derived betalains occurred in a metabolic environment enriched for tyrosine."

Many studies indicate that this form of convergent evolution is widespread in specialised plant metabolism (Pichersky & Lewinsohn, 2011). For example, the enzymes that methylate purine intermediates in caffeine biosynthesis in Coffea vs Thea evolved from different branches of the SABATH carboxyl methyltransferase family (Yoneyama et al., 2006); and disparate origins of pyrrolizidine alkaloids have arisen through recurrent evolution of homospermidine synthase from the ubiquitous enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (Reimann et al., 2004). However, the detection of this same phenomenon in the evolution of betalains is perhaps surprising, because the retention of enzymes for anthocyanin biosynthesis in betalain-pigmented species (Shimada et al., 2004, 2005) has encouraged the assumption that reversals to anthocyanin are more likely than multiple shifts to betalain pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2011, 2015)."

The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments. l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family (Christinet et al., 2004). Within Caryophyllales, a gene duplication in the LigB/DODA gene lineage gave rise to the DODAalpha and DODAbeta clades, with l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity previously inferred to have evolved at the base of the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). On the basis of this Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, and subsequent losses of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages, we previously argued for a single origin of betalain pigmentation, with multiple reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015)."

      "context": "Previously, Lopez-Nieves et al. (2018) speculated that the evolution of tyrosine-derived betalains occurred in a metabolic environment enriched for tyrosine. The arogenate dehydrogenase enzyme (ADHalpha) responsible for increased tyrosine availability is also lost and/or down-regulated in the anthocyanic Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae lineages (Lopez-Nieves et al., 2018). Therefore, the shift to anthocyanins in these taxa may indicate deeper shifts away from a tyrosine-rich metabolism towards a metabolism in which phenylalanine plays a canonical role. The primary function of the DODAalpha paralogues with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity is unknown, but may catalyse production of tyrosine-derived metabolites, other than betalains. In this scenario, the duplication that gave rise to the DODAbeta and DODAalpha lineages led to neofunctionalisation in the DODAalpha lineage towards an unknown but tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Loss of DODA alpha in Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae could instead reflect loss of the unknown tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, in the context of shifts towards more phenylalanine-biased metabolism, independent of origins of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity."

The maximum likelihood phylogeny of Caryophyllales l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes was inferred from coding sequences derived from genomes and transcriptomes. Branch lengths are expected number of substitutions per site. Scale bar gives 0.2 expected substitutions per site. Branch labels are support values for major paralogous clades from rapid bootstrapping and the SH-like Approximate Likelihood Ratio Test, respectively, given as RBS/SH-aLRT. Putative major duplication nodes are highlighted with stars. Branches are coloured according to the putative pigmentation state of the taxa (blue, anthocyanin; pink, betalain). Labelled tips show functionally characterised DODAs and shaded squares correspond to DODA activity (white, no activity; grey, marginal activity; black, high activity). Asterisks indicate putative pseudogenes. Annotated at tips is a colour-coded alignment of the seven residues conferring high activity reported in Bean et al. (2018).

Specialised metabolites are critical for survival in particular ecological niches and are often taxonomically restricted (Weng, 2014). In flowering plants, one remarkable example of a taxonomically restricted specialised metabolite occurs in the angiosperm order Caryophyllales (Brockington et al., 2011; Timoneda et al., 2019). Here, tyrosine-derived betalain pigments have evolved to replace anthocyanins, which are otherwise ubiquitous across flowering plants (Bischoff, 1876; Clement & Mabry, 1996). Betalains are also present in the fungal lineage Basidiomycota (Musso, 1979) and the bacterial species Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus (Contreras-Llano et al., 2019)."

      "context": "In contrast to the anthocyanin pathway, the betalain biosynthetic pathway is relatively simple, involving as few as four enzymatic steps to proceed from tyrosine to stable betalain pigments: yellow betaxanthins and violet betacyanins (Fig. 1). The core genes encoding betalain synthesis enzymes have been elucidated, primarily through heterologous assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana, which has emerged as an essential tool for betalain research in planta (Polturak et al., 2016; Timoneda et al., 2018). The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments. l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family (Christinet et al., 2004). Within Caryophyllales, a gene duplication in the LigB/DODA gene lineage gave rise to the DODAalpha and DODAbeta clades, with l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity previously inferred to have evolved at the base of the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). On the basis of this Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, and subsequent losses of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages, we previously argued for a single origin of betalain pigmentation, with multiple reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015)."

      "context": "Such a model, in which similar enzymatic function has arisen repeatedly from homologous but nonorthologous enzymes, is not unprecedented. Many studies indicate that this form of convergent evolution is widespread in specialised plant metabolism (Pichersky & Lewinsohn, 2011). For example, the enzymes that methylate purine intermediates in caffeine biosynthesis in Coffea vs Thea evolved from different branches of the SABATH carboxyl methyltransferase family (Yoneyama et al., 2006); and disparate origins of pyrrolizidine alkaloids have arisen through recurrent evolution of homospermidine synthase from the ubiquitous enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (Reimann et al., 2004). However, the detection of this same phenomenon in the evolution of betalains is perhaps surprising, because the retention of enzymes for anthocyanin biosynthesis in betalain-pigmented species (Shimada et al., 2004, 2005) has encouraged the assumption that reversals to anthocyanin are more likely than multiple shifts to betalain pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2011, 2015)."

Many studies indicate that this form of convergent evolution is widespread in specialised plant metabolism (Pichersky & Lewinsohn, 2011). For example, the enzymes that methylate purine intermediates in caffeine biosynthesis in Coffea vs Thea evolved from different branches of the SABATH carboxyl methyltransferase family (Yoneyama et al., 2006); and disparate origins of pyrrolizidine alkaloids have arisen through recurrent evolution of homospermidine synthase from the ubiquitous enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (Reimann et al., 2004). However, the detection of this same phenomenon in the evolution of betalains is perhaps surprising, because the retention of enzymes for anthocyanin biosynthesis in betalain-pigmented species (Shimada et al., 2004, 2005) has encouraged the assumption that reversals to anthocyanin are more likely than multiple shifts to betalain pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2011, 2015)."

The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments. l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family (Christinet et al., 2004). Within Caryophyllales, a gene duplication in the LigB/DODA gene lineage gave rise to the DODAalpha and DODAbeta clades, with l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity previously inferred to have evolved at the base of the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). On the basis of this Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, and subsequent losses of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages, we previously argued for a single origin of betalain pigmentation, with multiple reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015)."

In betalain-producing families within the core Caryophyllales, anthocyanins have not been found (Bate-Smith, 1962; Clement & Mabry, 1996), although earlier substrates and associated enzymes in the flavonoid pathway have been detected (Shimada et al., 2004, 2005; Polturak et al., 2018). However, anthocyanins have been reported in six core Caryophyllales families, namely Caryophyllaceae, Molluginaceae, Kewaceae, Limeaceae, Macarthuriaceae and Simmondsiaceae (Clement & Mabry, 1996; Thulin et al., 2016). In these six anthocyanic lineages, betalains have not been detected, indicating that anthocyanins and betalains are mutually exclusive (Stafford, 1994; Clement & Mabry, 1996). The six anthocyanic lineages are intercalated with betalain-pigmented lineages resulting in a homoplastic distribution of these two pigments (Brockington et al., 2011). The distribution of anthocyanin and betalain-pigmented lineages is consistent with multiple origins of betalain pigmentation, a single origin of betalain pigmentation with multiple reversals to anthocyanin, or a combination of these scenarios (Brockington et al., 2011)."

The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs containing the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The infiltration spots are labelled according to the DODA variant. For all species, the pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector is included as a positive control (P). (b) The betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC and data were represented relative to the BvDODAalpha1 spot present in each biological replicate. The data were combined after calculating relative amounts (RQ) for each species from individual species-specific experiments (Supporting Information Figs S8-S11). Bars show means +- SD; n = 5 for S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, C. gigantea and M. crystallinum, except for BvDODAalpha2 (n = 4) and BvDODAalpha3 (n = 4). (c) A representative HPLC trace for the DODA\nalpha\n1 gene from each species. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation.

      "context": "In contrast to the anthocyanin pathway, the betalain biosynthetic pathway is relatively simple, involving as few as four enzymatic steps to proceed from tyrosine to stable betalain pigments: yellow betaxanthins and violet betacyanins (Fig. 1). The core genes encoding betalain synthesis enzymes have been elucidated, primarily through heterologous assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana, which has emerged as an essential tool for betalain research in planta (Polturak et al., 2016; Timoneda et al., 2018). The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments. l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family (Christinet et al., 2004). Within Caryophyllales, a gene duplication in the LigB/DODA gene lineage gave rise to the DODAalpha and DODAbeta clades, with l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity previously inferred to have evolved at the base of the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). On the basis of this Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, and subsequent losses of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages, we previously argued for a single origin of betalain pigmentation, with multiple reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015)."

The pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector was included as a positive control (P). (b) Betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC. Amounts of betanin were calculated relative (RQ) to the average amount of betanin present in BvDODAalpha1 infiltration spots for each species and the data combined into one graph (see Supporting Information Fig. S12 for species-specific data). Bars show means +- SD; n >= 3. (c) A representative HPLC trace for each DODA\nalpha gene from each species is shown. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl, which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples."

Many studies indicate that this form of convergent evolution is widespread in specialised plant metabolism (Pichersky & Lewinsohn, 2011). For example, the enzymes that methylate purine intermediates in caffeine biosynthesis in Coffea vs Thea evolved from different branches of the SABATH carboxyl methyltransferase family (Yoneyama et al., 2006); and disparate origins of pyrrolizidine alkaloids have arisen through recurrent evolution of homospermidine synthase from the ubiquitous enzyme deoxyhypusine synthase (Reimann et al., 2004). However, the detection of this same phenomenon in the evolution of betalains is perhaps surprising, because the retention of enzymes for anthocyanin biosynthesis in betalain-pigmented species (Shimada et al., 2004, 2005) has encouraged the assumption that reversals to anthocyanin are more likely than multiple shifts to betalain pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2011, 2015)."

      "context": "Previously, Lopez-Nieves et al. (2018) speculated that the evolution of tyrosine-derived betalains occurred in a metabolic environment enriched for tyrosine. The arogenate dehydrogenase enzyme (ADHalpha) responsible for increased tyrosine availability is also lost and/or down-regulated in the anthocyanic Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae lineages (Lopez-Nieves et al., 2018). Therefore, the shift to anthocyanins in these taxa may indicate deeper shifts away from a tyrosine-rich metabolism towards a metabolism in which phenylalanine plays a canonical role. The primary function of the DODAalpha paralogues with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity is unknown, but may catalyse production of tyrosine-derived metabolites, other than betalains. In this scenario, the duplication that gave rise to the DODAbeta and DODAalpha lineages led to neofunctionalisation in the DODAalpha lineage towards an unknown but tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Loss of DODA alpha in Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae could instead reflect loss of the unknown tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, in the context of shifts towards more phenylalanine-biased metabolism, independent of origins of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity."

Here, we explicitly account for the large number of taxa for which pigmentation status is unknown and constrain our phylogenetic hypothesis to match the latest phylogenomic study of Walker et al. (2018), which places betalain-pigmented Stegnospermataceae as sister to anthocyanic Macarthuriaceae. In the context of these new data (Fig. 2), our reconstructions do not infer a single evolution of betalains, as previously suggested (Brockington et al., 2015), but rather imply up to four separate origins of betalain pigmentation in Caryophyllales."

The arogenate dehydrogenase enzyme (ADHalpha) responsible for increased tyrosine availability is also lost and/or down-regulated in the anthocyanic Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae lineages (Lopez-Nieves et al., 2018). Therefore, the shift to anthocyanins in these taxa may indicate deeper shifts away from a tyrosine-rich metabolism towards a metabolism in which phenylalanine plays a canonical role. The primary function of the DODAalpha paralogues with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity is unknown, but may catalyse production of tyrosine-derived metabolites, other than betalains. In this scenario, the duplication that gave rise to the DODAbeta and DODAalpha lineages led to neofunctionalisation in the DODAalpha lineage towards an unknown but tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Loss of DODA alpha in Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae could instead reflect loss of the unknown tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, in the context of shifts towards more phenylalanine-biased metabolism, independent of origins of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity."

Therefore, the shift to anthocyanins in these taxa may indicate deeper shifts away from a tyrosine-rich metabolism towards a metabolism in which phenylalanine plays a canonical role. The primary function of the DODAalpha paralogues with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity is unknown, but may catalyse production of tyrosine-derived metabolites, other than betalains. In this scenario, the duplication that gave rise to the DODAbeta and DODAalpha lineages led to neofunctionalisation in the DODAalpha lineage towards an unknown but tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Loss of DODA alpha in Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae could instead reflect loss of the unknown tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, in the context of shifts towards more phenylalanine-biased metabolism, independent of origins of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity."
