			"context": "Changes in the glucose:sucrose ratio are important for the development of both dicot and monocot seeds (Weschke et al.,). In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5).\nThus far, SvSWEET4 has been shown to probably have a role in the post-phloem pathway of sink tissues, particularly in the seed. To determine if SvSWEET4 and/or other SWEETs were temporally expressed during seed head development, poly(A)-enriched RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) was carried out (Fig. 6; Supplementary Fig. S10). The expression of SWEET genes was compared with that of the genes that encode key proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism during the seed filling process so that transport, metabolism, and carbohydrate content could be correlated. A comprehensive list of genes encoding enzymes and transporters in seed filling was collated to examine their expression at different stages of development in A.10 and ME034V ecotypes (Supplementary Dataset S2; Supplementary Figs S3, S10). From this, a subset of the most highly expressed genes was identified from the different gene families encoding sugar-related metabolism and transport proteins in the A.10 ecotype (Fig. 6). qPCR of SvSWEET4a was also carried out on leaf, stem, and seed head tissue alongside other SWEET genes to provide an overall view of the pattern of expression (Supplementary Fig. S11). These SWEET genes were chosen based on previous evidence for their expression in the leaf and/or sinks."

			"context": "Phloem unloading and the capacity of the post-phloem transport pathway for photoassimilates are major determinants of yield in many cereal crops which are harvested for their grains and/or stems. In many cereals, it has been established that SUT1 is integral to apoplastic phloem unloading in seeds. Thus far, there has been some evidence for the role of SWEETs in seed filling in maize and rice. In maize, zmsweet4c and miniature1 mutants have both been shown to exhibit an impaired seed filling phenotype and lack a fully differentiated basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL), the latter of which has a gene knockout that usually encodes a cell wall invertase specific to the endosperm. Mutational analysis commonly produces developmental disruptions resulting in aberrant tissue structures, confounding the interpretation of the phenotypes observed because the lack of gene expression could have disrupted transport at any stage of development. Thus, genetic studies provide limited developmental stage-specific information on the role of SWEETs in grain development and do not provide the spatial information on the physical location of these proteins within the reproductive structures needed to support a model of sugar movement. The broad developmental expression of ZmSWEET4 orthologues (Supplementary Fig. S12) makes this issue even more important as a knockout could have a multitude of effects during development at any stage from fertilization to grain filling."

			"context": "Phloem unloading and the capacity of the post-phloem transport pathway for photoassimilates are major determinants of yield in many cereal crops which are harvested for their grains and/or stems. In many cereals, it has been established that SUT1 is integral to apoplastic phloem unloading in seeds. Thus far, there has been some evidence for the role of SWEETs in seed filling in maize and rice. In maize, zmsweet4c and miniature1 mutants have both been shown to exhibit an impaired seed filling phenotype and lack a fully differentiated basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL), the latter of which has a gene knockout that usually encodes a cell wall invertase specific to the endosperm. Mutational analysis commonly produces developmental disruptions resulting in aberrant tissue structures, confounding the interpretation of the phenotypes observed because the lack of gene expression could have disrupted transport at any stage of development. Thus, genetic studies provide limited developmental stage-specific information on the role of SWEETs in grain development and do not provide the spatial information on the physical location of these proteins within the reproductive structures needed to support a model of sugar movement. The broad developmental expression of ZmSWEET4 orthologues (Supplementary Fig. S12) makes this issue even more important as a knockout could have a multitude of effects during development at any stage from fertilization to grain filling."

			"context": "Changes in the glucose:sucrose ratio are important for the development of both dicot and monocot seeds (Weschke et al.,). In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

Within cereal seeds, these shifts have been linked to high invertase activity, which results in high hexose to sucrose ratios during cell division. Later in development when cell expansion and storage begins, this changes to a high sucrose to hexose ratio, concomitant with high sucrose synthase (SuSy) activity. The seed is broadly comprised of the pericarp/seed coat, nucellus, embryo and endosperm, separated by the scutellum. While the general structures of monocot and dicot seeds are somewhat similar, there are some stark differences between species. Cereals are known for large starchy seeds, unlike dicots such as Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and hence require a large flux of photoassimilates to occur during seed filling."

To determine if SvSWEET4 and/or other SWEETs were temporally expressed during seed head development, poly(A)-enriched RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) was carried out (Fig. 6; Supplementary Fig. S10). The expression of SWEET genes was compared with that of the genes that encode key proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism during the seed filling process so that transport, metabolism, and carbohydrate content could be correlated. A comprehensive list of genes encoding enzymes and transporters in seed filling was collated to examine their expression at different stages of development in A.10 and ME034V ecotypes (Supplementary Dataset S2; Supplementary Figs S3, S10). From this, a subset of the most highly expressed genes was identified from the different gene families encoding sugar-related metabolism and transport proteins in the A.10 ecotype (Fig. 6). qPCR of SvSWEET4a was also carried out on leaf, stem, and seed head tissue alongside other SWEET genes to provide an overall view of the pattern of expression (Supplementary Fig. S11). These SWEET genes were chosen based on previous evidence for their expression in the leaf and/or sinks."

In many cereals, it has been established that SUT1 is integral to apoplastic phloem unloading in seeds. Thus far, there has been some evidence for the role of SWEETs in seed filling in maize and rice. In maize, zmsweet4c and miniature1 mutants have both been shown to exhibit an impaired seed filling phenotype and lack a fully differentiated basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL), the latter of which has a gene knockout that usually encodes a cell wall invertase specific to the endosperm. Mutational analysis commonly produces developmental disruptions resulting in aberrant tissue structures, confounding the interpretation of the phenotypes observed because the lack of gene expression could have disrupted transport at any stage of development. Thus, genetic studies provide limited developmental stage-specific information on the role of SWEETs in grain development and do not provide the spatial information on the physical location of these proteins within the reproductive structures needed to support a model of sugar movement. The broad developmental expression of ZmSWEET4 orthologues (Supplementary Fig. S12) makes this issue even more important as a knockout could have a multitude of effects during development at any stage from fertilization to grain filling."

			"context": "Using immunolocalization, SvSWEET4 was detected at the maternal-filial and filial-filial cell interfaces of the Setaria seed. Previously, it has been shown that SUT1 functions during the grain filling process of rice and wheat, and is usually found at the interface between the maternal and filial cells. Since SWEETs and SUTs are often co-expressed in the same or adjacent cells, it is unsurprising that SvSWEET4 was also found at similar interfaces (Fig. 2). Presumably in Setaria, photoassimilates that reach the placental vascular bundle through the symplast must be exported into the apoplast, which we propose is mediated by SvSWEET4 (Fig. 2E, F). The placental pad, where the symplastic barrier between maternal and filial tissues probably occurs in Setaria, and in all species examined thus far, is then the site for the majority of sugar flux out of maternal tissues into filial tissues across the highly invaginated transfer aleurone layer. Once photoassimilates reach the placental pad cells, they could move freely from cell to cell symplastically and subsequently into the apoplast at the filial interface. The cells within the placental pad are thought to be senescent and have been observed to contain plasmodesmatal pits, probably suggesting there are symplastic connections between these cells."

			"justification": "Although the text discusses the possible involvement of multivesicular bodies in sugar transport and mentions that AtSWEET9 localizes to multivesicular bodies, it does not explicitly state or strongly imply that sucrose is present in, made in, or accumulates in multivesicular bodies.",
			"context": "SvSWEET4 protein was also present in maternal tissues along the vascular transport pathway such as the terminal vascular bundles of the pedicel (Figs 2, 3). This suggests that SWEET4 participates early in the phloem unloading pathway or in the immediate steps in the post-phloem pathway (Figs 2A, D, G; 3A; Supplementary Fig. S7). These cells in the vasculature are likely to be parenchyma cells, as was observed in the stem, where localization appeared to be more specifically at the xylem parenchyma (Fig. 3C-E). Prior to the discovery of SWEETs, it was shown in the maize pedicel tissue that photoassimilates were exported from the cells into the apoplast but it was unknown how this occurred. Solutes might move symplastically down a concentration gradient into parenchyma cells and subsequently be unloaded into the apoplast by SvSWEET4 (Fig. 7B). This would be consistent with the high Km of SvSWEET4a for sucrose reported here, which is of the same order as the sucrose concentration present in the phloem (~1 M). Sugars can then be utilized for storage elsewhere or used in synthesis of structural carbohydrates, for example in sclerenchyma cells immediately adjacent to the site of unloading (Figs 2G, 3A-E; Supplementary Fig. S7A-E). Interestingly, the localization pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma was atypical of localization to the plasma membrane and possibly more reminiscent of detection in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi body. These organelles are essential for facilitating the transfer of sugars to proteins, lipids, proteoglycans, and polysaccharides of the plant cell wall. Consequently, SvSWEET4 could aid in this process given it was found in highly lignified tissue structures of the stem and pedicel (Figs 2, 3). In legumes, xylem parenchyma transfer cells have been observed within the stem, so there is a possibility that SvSWEET4 is located on highly invaginated transfer cells of the stem and pedicel where large fluxes of solutes must occur. In Arabidopsis, AtSWEET9 has previously been shown to localize to the plasma membrane, the trans-Golgi apparatus, and multivesicular bodies, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SWEET fusions. SvSWEET4 could load vesicles with sugars for exo- or endocytosis or export sugars from the vesicles depending on the sugar gradient. In the rice leaf blade, vesicles have been observed within the xylem parenchyma cells where endocytosis might occur for xylem sap retrieval from the apoplast. In plants it has been postulated that photoassimilate uptake can also be mediated by endocytosis and is perhaps sucrose induced, although this has not yet been shown in planta. The immunodetection pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma of stems might provide the first line of evidence for this within the plant."

			"context": "SWEETs play a role in transmembrane sugar movement within sink tissue of Setaria, specifically in the post-phloem transport of sugars in the seed. A model is proposed for their function in seeds in Fig. 7. The relatively stable hexose:sucrose ratio throughout grain development, and the unremarkable changes in developmental expression of genes encoding SWEETs, HXTs, or SUTs together suggest that the post-phloem pathway is uncharacteristic of other cereals. The predominant expression of SWEET4 in sinks rather than source tissue of Setaria (see) supports a role for this transporter in these pathways of monocots. Localization of SvSWEET4 proteins to a range of symplastically isolated filial cells, the vasculature of the seed, and xylem parenchyma of the stem supports this hypothesis. Moreover, the demonstration that SvSWEET4a is an exceptionally high-capacity, low-affinity transporter of glucose and sucrose is consistent with the high sugar fluxes required to support accumulation of carbohydrate in seed and stem tissues of cereals. These findings presented in S. viridis on SWEET4 highlight the need to expand research into cereal crops beyond maize and rice to better understand the post-phloem pathway influencing sink capacity and yield."

Within cereal seeds, these shifts have been linked to high invertase activity, which results in high hexose to sucrose ratios during cell division. Later in development when cell expansion and storage begins, this changes to a high sucrose to hexose ratio, concomitant with high sucrose synthase (SuSy) activity. The seed is broadly comprised of the pericarp/seed coat, nucellus, embryo and endosperm, separated by the scutellum. While the general structures of monocot and dicot seeds are somewhat similar, there are some stark differences between species. Cereals are known for large starchy seeds, unlike dicots such as Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and hence require a large flux of photoassimilates to occur during seed filling."

Photoassimilates must be transported apoplastically, crossing several membrane barriers, a process facilitated by sugar transporters. Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEETs) have been proposed to play a crucial role in apoplastic sugar transport during phloem unloading and the post-phloem pathway in sink tissues. Evidence for this is presented here for developing seeds of the C4 model grass Setaria viridis. Using immunolocalization, SvSWEET4 was detected in various maternal and filial tissues within the seed along the sugar transport pathway, in the vascular parenchyma of the pedicel, and in the xylem parenchyma of the stem. Expression of SvSWEET4a in Xenopus laevis oocytes indicated that it functions as a high-capacity glucose and sucrose transporter. Carbohydrate and transcriptional profiling of Setaria seed heads showed that there were some developmental shifts in hexose and sucrose content and consistent expression of SvSWEET4 homologues. Collectively, these results provide evidence for the involvement of SWEETs in the apoplastic transport pathway of sink tissues and allow a pathway for post-phloem sugar transport into the seed to be proposed."

			"context": "The genus Setaria contains a number of small grain millets, notably Setaria italica (Foxtail millet), one of the oldest domesticated and widely adapted grain crops globally and an important component of food production in developing countries. Setaria viridis (Green foxtail), a small, closely related, easily transformable relative with a small sequenced genome, is becoming a widely used genetic model for functional genomics and genetics in millets. Despite the importance of millets, the pathway of post-phloem sugar movement in their grains is poorly characterized. Here we seek to understand the role SWEETs might play in phloem unloading and the post-phloem pathway during seed development and filling in S. viridis (Setaria). Previous literature has seen a trend in SWEET4 orthologues being expressed predominantly in sinks such as stems and/or seeds of sorghum, rice, maize, sugarcane, and Setaria, suggesting a role in phloem unloading or the steps immediately following this. Here SWEET4a from S. viridis is examined with a particular focus on the seed head using a combination of immunohistochemistry, functional characterization, major carbohydrate profiling, and expression analyses. These results expand our understanding of SWEETs in the phloem unloading and post-phloem pathway of C4 grasses, and the data are used to propose a pathway for sugar movement from the phloem to the endosperm tissue of Setaria seeds."

To determine if SvSWEET4 and/or other SWEETs were temporally expressed during seed head development, poly(A)-enriched RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) was carried out (Fig. 6; Supplementary Fig. S10). The expression of SWEET genes was compared with that of the genes that encode key proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism during the seed filling process so that transport, metabolism, and carbohydrate content could be correlated. A comprehensive list of genes encoding enzymes and transporters in seed filling was collated to examine their expression at different stages of development in A.10 and ME034V ecotypes (Supplementary Dataset S2; Supplementary Figs S3, S10). From this, a subset of the most highly expressed genes was identified from the different gene families encoding sugar-related metabolism and transport proteins in the A.10 ecotype (Fig. 6). qPCR of SvSWEET4a was also carried out on leaf, stem, and seed head tissue alongside other SWEET genes to provide an overall view of the pattern of expression (Supplementary Fig. S11). These SWEET genes were chosen based on previous evidence for their expression in the leaf and/or sinks."

Thus far, there has been some evidence for the role of SWEETs in seed filling in maize and rice.

Mutational analysis commonly produces developmental disruptions resulting in aberrant tissue structures, confounding the interpretation of the phenotypes observed because the lack of gene expression could have disrupted transport at any stage of development. Thus, genetic studies provide limited developmental stage-specific information on the role of SWEETs in grain development and do not provide the spatial information on the physical location of these proteins within the reproductive structures needed to support a model of sugar movement. The broad developmental expression of ZmSWEET4 orthologues (Supplementary Fig. S12) makes this issue even more important as a knockout could have a multitude of effects during development at any stage from fertilization to grain filling."

			"context": "Changes in the glucose:sucrose ratio are important for the development of both dicot and monocot seeds (Weschke et al.,). In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

			"context": "In monocots, the active sucrose transporter SUT1 has long been implicated in seed filling, functioning to import sucrose from the apoplast surrounding seed maternal tissues into filial cells. Evidence has shown that SUT1 transcript and protein were abundant in cereal seeds, localized to cells at the interface between maternal and filial tissues, and that suppression or knockout of this transporter resulted in highly impaired grain filling. For example, antisense suppression of SUT1 in rice resulted in little to no grain filling, leading to a shrivelled grain phenotype. Until recently, the mechanism of sugar export out of maternal cells into the apoplast for uptake by SUTs has remained elusive. The discovery of Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEETs) potentially provided a mechanism for this process, with recent studies suggesting that SWEETs first export sugars into the apoplast before being imported into cells by SUTs or hexose transporters (HXTs) depending on the nature of sugars present at the membrane interface. Despite this potentially universal model for SWEET function, the diversity in seed morphology and structure present even in the grasses means that many components of sugar movement during seed filling remain unresolved. Numerous post-phloem membrane barriers exist within a single seed, thus SWEETs could potentially be found at various interfaces. Previous studies using reverse genetics which have implicated SWEETs in this transport pathway have not resolved this issue and prevent the elucidation of a model pathway for post-phloem sugar transport which includes the involvement of SWEETs."

In many cereals, it has been established that SUT1 is integral to apoplastic phloem unloading in seeds. Thus far, there has been some evidence for the role of SWEETs in seed filling in maize and rice. In maize, zmsweet4c and miniature1 mutants have both been shown to exhibit an impaired seed filling phenotype and lack a fully differentiated basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL), the latter of which has a gene knockout that usually encodes a cell wall invertase specific to the endosperm. Mutational analysis commonly produces developmental disruptions resulting in aberrant tissue structures, confounding the interpretation of the phenotypes observed because the lack of gene expression could have disrupted transport at any stage of development. Thus, genetic studies provide limited developmental stage-specific information on the role of SWEETs in grain development and do not provide the spatial information on the physical location of these proteins within the reproductive structures needed to support a model of sugar movement. The broad developmental expression of ZmSWEET4 orthologues (Supplementary Fig. S12) makes this issue even more important as a knockout could have a multitude of effects during development at any stage from fertilization to grain filling."

			"context": "In monocots, the active sucrose transporter SUT1 has long been implicated in seed filling, functioning to import sucrose from the apoplast surrounding seed maternal tissues into filial cells. Evidence has shown that SUT1 transcript and protein were abundant in cereal seeds, localized to cells at the interface between maternal and filial tissues, and that suppression or knockout of this transporter resulted in highly impaired grain filling. For example, antisense suppression of SUT1 in rice resulted in little to no grain filling, leading to a shrivelled grain phenotype. Until recently, the mechanism of sugar export out of maternal cells into the apoplast for uptake by SUTs has remained elusive. The discovery of Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEETs) potentially provided a mechanism for this process, with recent studies suggesting that SWEETs first export sugars into the apoplast before being imported into cells by SUTs or hexose transporters (HXTs) depending on the nature of sugars present at the membrane interface. Despite this potentially universal model for SWEET function, the diversity in seed morphology and structure present even in the grasses means that many components of sugar movement during seed filling remain unresolved. Numerous post-phloem membrane barriers exist within a single seed, thus SWEETs could potentially be found at various interfaces. Previous studies using reverse genetics which have implicated SWEETs in this transport pathway have not resolved this issue and prevent the elucidation of a model pathway for post-phloem sugar transport which includes the involvement of SWEETs."

SuSy activity in maize increases during seed maturation as rates of carbohydrate accumulation peak. This was not apparent in Setaria where SuSy transcripts remained relatively high and unchanged throughout development (Fig. 6). In maize, mutants with defective SuSy and cell wall invertase were shown to have a shrunken seed phenotype. Cell wall invertase has been thought to be important for mitotic cell division whilst SuSy breaks down sucrose to provide the substrates necessary for starch synthesis. In these mutational studies, the possibility that both these enzymes are important at all stages of seed development cannot be ruled out as the proteins are absent from all tissue types in the seed of these mutants from germination to desiccation and the phenotype in both cases is shrunken, unfilled seeds. In rice and barley, both C3 grasses, cell wall invertase is also expressed early in seed development and proposed to be important for establishing a high hexose:sucrose ratio, promoting cell division. Setaria seed did not exhibit these correlations between sugar species, sucrolytic enzyme levels, and patterns of development, which might indicate that this sugar signal is not integral to the control of seed development in this plant species."

			"context": "Mutational analysis commonly produces developmental disruptions resulting in aberrant tissue structures, confounding the interpretation of the phenotypes observed because the lack of gene expression could have disrupted transport at any stage of development.\nThus, genetic studies provide limited developmental stage-specific information on the role of SWEETs in grain development and do not provide the spatial information on the physical location of these proteins within the reproductive structures needed to support a model of sugar movement.\nThe broad developmental expression of ZmSWEET4 orthologues (Supplementary Fig. S12) makes this issue even more important as a knockout could have a multitude of effects during development at any stage from fertilization to grain filling.\nChanges in the glucose:sucrose ratio are important for the development of both dicot and monocot seeds (Weschke et al.,). In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

			"context": "The genus Setaria contains a number of small grain millets, notably Setaria italica (Foxtail millet), one of the oldest domesticated and widely adapted grain crops globally and an important component of food production in developing countries. Setaria viridis (Green foxtail), a small, closely related, easily transformable relative with a small sequenced genome, is becoming a widely used genetic model for functional genomics and genetics in millets. Despite the importance of millets, the pathway of post-phloem sugar movement in their grains is poorly characterized. Here we seek to understand the role SWEETs might play in phloem unloading and the post-phloem pathway during seed development and filling in S. viridis (Setaria). Previous literature has seen a trend in SWEET4 orthologues being expressed predominantly in sinks such as stems and/or seeds of sorghum, rice, maize, sugarcane, and Setaria, suggesting a role in phloem unloading or the steps immediately following this. Here SWEET4a from S. viridis is examined with a particular focus on the seed head using a combination of immunohistochemistry, functional characterization, major carbohydrate profiling, and expression analyses. These results expand our understanding of SWEETs in the phloem unloading and post-phloem pathway of C4 grasses, and the data are used to propose a pathway for sugar movement from the phloem to the endosperm tissue of Setaria seeds."

In many cereals, it has been established that SUT1 is integral to apoplastic phloem unloading in seeds. Thus far, there has been some evidence for the role of SWEETs in seed filling in maize and rice. In maize, zmsweet4c and miniature1 mutants have both been shown to exhibit an impaired seed filling phenotype and lack a fully differentiated basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL), the latter of which has a gene knockout that usually encodes a cell wall invertase specific to the endosperm. Mutational analysis commonly produces developmental disruptions resulting in aberrant tissue structures, confounding the interpretation of the phenotypes observed because the lack of gene expression could have disrupted transport at any stage of development. Thus, genetic studies provide limited developmental stage-specific information on the role of SWEETs in grain development and do not provide the spatial information on the physical location of these proteins within the reproductive structures needed to support a model of sugar movement. The broad developmental expression of ZmSWEET4 orthologues (Supplementary Fig. S12) makes this issue even more important as a knockout could have a multitude of effects during development at any stage from fertilization to grain filling."

			"context": "Highly invaginated transfer cells, indicative of a region where a high level of nutrient flux must occur, are almost always seen in the filial tissues at the maternal-filial interface, and these are present in Setaria seeds (Fig. 2E, F, I; Supplementary Fig. S8A). SWEET4 protein abundantly decorated the membranes of these cells, suggestive of a role in high-capacity transport of glucose and/or sucrose at this interface to support the growing embryo and starchy endosperm of cereals. It was not possible to determine any 'sidedness' of expression which would help to determine whether SWEET4 was importing sugar into these cells down a gradient from the placental pad apoplast or facilitating transport between transfer cells and the underlying filial cell layers (Fig. 7D). In species such as wheat, barley, and rice, uptake of sucrose from the apoplast by the aleurone/modified aleurone layer is catalysed by the active transporter SUT1 during grain filling, suggesting that the latter option may be the case. Since SWEET4 can transport both glucose and sucrose, cell-specific sugar composition and sugar gradient measurements would be useful in delineating the mechanism of post-phloem sugar transport in this seed. Unfortunately, literature is scarce on carbohydrates measured within specific structures of the seed. Where there is a marked endosperm cavity, such as wheat, careful and laborious use of aphid stylet exudates suggested that the major sugar in this tissue is sucrose and there is a 10-fold gradient from the phloem sieve tubes to the endosperm cavity. However, in the placental sac of sorghum, it was shown that hexoses would reach up to 40 g l-1 in different varieties of sorghum with <10 g l-1 of sucrose. These sugar amounts equate to sugar concentrations of ~220 mM for glucose and 30 mM for sucrose; Km values obtained here for SWEET4 were 366 mM for glucose and 1.4 M for sucrose, considerably higher than the sugar content reported in the sorghum placental sac. Higher amounts of hexoses within the placental pad, well below the Km of SWEET4 for glucose, and the affinity for sucrose relative to measured amount might suggest that SvSWEET4a predominantly exports hexoses at the transfer aleurone interface for it to reach the endosperm.\nHypothetical model for the movement of photoassimilates within the Setaria seed. A simplified longitudinal section of the mature Setaria seed (A). Symplastic phloem unloading of sucrose (SUC) via plasmodesmata (PD) from the sieve element-companion cell (SE-CC) complex can be moved into the vascular parenchyma (VP) where SvSWEET4 (SW4; orange) exports it into the apoplast within the vascular bundle (VB) (B).

			"context": "Changes in the glucose:sucrose ratio are important for the development of both dicot and monocot seeds (Weschke et al.,). In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

Photoassimilates must be transported apoplastically, crossing several membrane barriers, a process facilitated by sugar transporters. Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEETs) have been proposed to play a crucial role in apoplastic sugar transport during phloem unloading and the post-phloem pathway in sink tissues. Evidence for this is presented here for developing seeds of the C4 model grass Setaria viridis. Using immunolocalization, SvSWEET4 was detected in various maternal and filial tissues within the seed along the sugar transport pathway, in the vascular parenchyma of the pedicel, and in the xylem parenchyma of the stem. Expression of SvSWEET4a in Xenopus laevis oocytes indicated that it functions as a high-capacity glucose and sucrose transporter. Carbohydrate and transcriptional profiling of Setaria seed heads showed that there were some developmental shifts in hexose and sucrose content and consistent expression of SvSWEET4 homologues. Collectively, these results provide evidence for the involvement of SWEETs in the apoplastic transport pathway of sink tissues and allow a pathway for post-phloem sugar transport into the seed to be proposed."

Alternatively, if SUC is not broken down, it is imported by SUT1 into the MCs. Photoassimilates that reach the nucellus are exported by SvSWEET4 and could be imported by a sugar transporter (e.g. HXT, SUT, or possibly a SWEET) (ST; beige) into the placental pad (PP) (C). Sugars that have reached the placental vascular bundle (PVB) are exported by SvSWEET4 into the apoplast and possibly taken up into the adjacent PP cells by an ST (D). Sugars move either sympastically or apoplastically into the highly invaginated transfer aleurone cells (TAL), exported by SvSWEET4, and then imported into the cuboidal aleurone cells (AL) to be again exported by SvSWEET4. As sugars cross the endosperm (ES) they reach the endosperm adjacent to scutellum (EAS) layer, exported by SvSWEET4, and imported into the scutellar epithelium (SCE) lining the scutellum (SCU) and ES interface where they are exported by SvSWEET4 again (E).

Cereals are known for large starchy seeds, unlike dicots such as Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and hence require a large flux of photoassimilates to occur during seed filling.\nHighly invaginated transfer cells, indicative of a region where a high level of nutrient flux must occur, are almost always seen in the filial tissues at the maternal-filial interface, and these are present in Setaria seeds (Fig. 2E, F, I; Supplementary Fig. S8A). SWEET4 protein abundantly decorated the membranes of these cells, suggestive of a role in high-capacity transport of glucose and/or sucrose at this interface to support the growing embryo and starchy endosperm of cereals. It was not possible to determine any 'sidedness' of expression which would help to determine whether SWEET4 was importing sugar into these cells down a gradient from the placental pad apoplast or facilitating transport between transfer cells and the underlying filial cell layers (Fig. 7D). In species such as wheat, barley, and rice, uptake of sucrose from the apoplast by the aleurone/modified aleurone layer is catalysed by the active transporter SUT1 during grain filling, suggesting that the latter option may be the case. Since SWEET4 can transport both glucose and sucrose, cell-specific sugar composition and sugar gradient measurements would be useful in delineating the mechanism of post-phloem sugar transport in this seed. Unfortunately, literature is scarce on carbohydrates measured within specific structures of the seed. Where there is a marked endosperm cavity, such as wheat, careful and laborious use of aphid stylet exudates suggested that the major sugar in this tissue is sucrose and there is a 10-fold gradient from the phloem sieve tubes to the endosperm cavity. However, in the placental sac of sorghum, it was shown that hexoses would reach up to 40 g l-1 in different varieties of sorghum with <10 g l-1 of sucrose. These sugar amounts equate to sugar concentrations of ~220 mM for glucose and 30 mM for sucrose; Km values obtained here for SWEET4 were 366 mM for glucose and 1.4 M for sucrose, considerably higher than the sugar content reported in the sorghum placental sac. Higher amounts of hexoses within the placental pad, well below the Km of SWEET4 for glucose, and the affinity for sucrose relative to measured amount might suggest that SvSWEET4a predominantly exports hexoses at the transfer aleurone interface for it to reach the endosperm."

Previous transcriptional studies on maize have implicated SWEETs at the EAS layer and BETL. While these studies only presented transcriptional data on SWEETs, immunodetection of SvSWEET4 protein carried out on equivalent structures in the Setaria seed confirm a role in these tissues. The presence of high-capacity SWEETs at the TAL and EAS is consistent with a physiological role in transporting large amounts of sugars into the endosperm down a concentration gradient during seed filling to support the high flux of sugars necessary for starch synthesis and embryo development (Figs 4C, D, 5). Moreover, it is interesting to note that the estimated Km and Vmax values of SvSWEET4a are much higher than previously published values. A high transport capacity was also observed from SWEETs found in the source leaf of Setaria. This might collectively indicate that SWEETs from C4 cereals can accommodate higher fluxes compared with C3 orthologues. Alternatively, SWEETs that predominate in sinks can reach high transport capacities to support growth and development, at least for SvSWEET4a (Fig. 4C, D). These results provide a foundation for further exploration of how the localization of SWEETs is linked with biochemistry. Nonetheless, given the promiscuity of some SWEETs, SvSWEET4a could equally transport sucrose down a sugar gradient generated by invertase activity. Such activity would subsequently build up a hexose gradient for ongoing transport of reduced sugars via SvSWEET4a to adjacent cells for rapid metabolic consumption (Fig. 7). This could be confirmed by immunolocalization of specific invertase isoforms to individual cell types within the seed structure at different stages of development."

			"context": "Changes in the glucose:sucrose ratio are important for the development of both dicot and monocot seeds (Weschke et al.,). In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

A model is proposed for their function in seeds in Fig. 7. The relatively stable hexose:sucrose ratio throughout grain development, and the unremarkable changes in developmental expression of genes encoding SWEETs, HXTs, or SUTs together suggest that the post-phloem pathway is uncharacteristic of other cereals. The predominant expression of SWEET4 in sinks rather than source tissue of Setaria (see) supports a role for this transporter in these pathways of monocots. Localization of SvSWEET4 proteins to a range of symplastically isolated filial cells, the vasculature of the seed, and xylem parenchyma of the stem supports this hypothesis. Moreover, the demonstration that SvSWEET4a is an exceptionally high-capacity, low-affinity transporter of glucose and sucrose is consistent with the high sugar fluxes required to support accumulation of carbohydrate in seed and stem tissues of cereals. These findings presented in S. viridis on SWEET4 highlight the need to expand research into cereal crops beyond maize and rice to better understand the post-phloem pathway influencing sink capacity and yield."

Cereals are known for large starchy seeds, unlike dicots such as Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and hence require a large flux of photoassimilates to occur during seed filling."

			"context": "Changes in the glucose:sucrose ratio are important for the development of both dicot and monocot seeds (Weschke et al.,). In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

A model is proposed for their function in seeds in Fig. 7. The relatively stable hexose:sucrose ratio throughout grain development, and the unremarkable changes in developmental expression of genes encoding SWEETs, HXTs, or SUTs together suggest that the post-phloem pathway is uncharacteristic of other cereals. The predominant expression of SWEET4 in sinks rather than source tissue of Setaria (see) supports a role for this transporter in these pathways of monocots. Localization of SvSWEET4 proteins to a range of symplastically isolated filial cells, the vasculature of the seed, and xylem parenchyma of the stem supports this hypothesis. Moreover, the demonstration that SvSWEET4a is an exceptionally high-capacity, low-affinity transporter of glucose and sucrose is consistent with the high sugar fluxes required to support accumulation of carbohydrate in seed and stem tissues of cereals. These findings presented in S. viridis on SWEET4 highlight the need to expand research into cereal crops beyond maize and rice to better understand the post-phloem pathway influencing sink capacity and yield."

			"context": "Highly invaginated transfer cells, indicative of a region where a high level of nutrient flux must occur, are almost always seen in the filial tissues at the maternal-filial interface, and these are present in Setaria seeds (Fig. 2E, F, I; Supplementary Fig. S8A). SWEET4 protein abundantly decorated the membranes of these cells, suggestive of a role in high-capacity transport of glucose and/or sucrose at this interface to support the growing embryo and starchy endosperm of cereals. It was not possible to determine any 'sidedness' of expression which would help to determine whether SWEET4 was importing sugar into these cells down a gradient from the placental pad apoplast or facilitating transport between transfer cells and the underlying filial cell layers (Fig. 7D). In species such as wheat, barley, and rice, uptake of sucrose from the apoplast by the aleurone/modified aleurone layer is catalysed by the active transporter SUT1 during grain filling, suggesting that the latter option may be the case. Since SWEET4 can transport both glucose and sucrose, cell-specific sugar composition and sugar gradient measurements would be useful in delineating the mechanism of post-phloem sugar transport in this seed. Unfortunately, literature is scarce on carbohydrates measured within specific structures of the seed. Where there is a marked endosperm cavity, such as wheat, careful and laborious use of aphid stylet exudates suggested that the major sugar in this tissue is sucrose and there is a 10-fold gradient from the phloem sieve tubes to the endosperm cavity. However, in the placental sac of sorghum, it was shown that hexoses would reach up to 40 g l-1 in different varieties of sorghum with <10 g l-1 of sucrose. These sugar amounts equate to sugar concentrations of ~220 mM for glucose and 30 mM for sucrose; Km values obtained here for SWEET4 were 366 mM for glucose and 1.4 M for sucrose, considerably higher than the sugar content reported in the sorghum placental sac. Higher amounts of hexoses within the placental pad, well below the Km of SWEET4 for glucose, and the affinity for sucrose relative to measured amount might suggest that SvSWEET4a predominantly exports hexoses at the transfer aleurone interface for it to reach the endosperm."

SuSy activity in maize increases during seed maturation as rates of carbohydrate accumulation peak. This was not apparent in Setaria where SuSy transcripts remained relatively high and unchanged throughout development (Fig. 6). In maize, mutants with defective SuSy and cell wall invertase were shown to have a shrunken seed phenotype. Cell wall invertase has been thought to be important for mitotic cell division whilst SuSy breaks down sucrose to provide the substrates necessary for starch synthesis. In these mutational studies, the possibility that both these enzymes are important at all stages of seed development cannot be ruled out as the proteins are absent from all tissue types in the seed of these mutants from germination to desiccation and the phenotype in both cases is shrunken, unfilled seeds. In rice and barley, both C3 grasses, cell wall invertase is also expressed early in seed development and proposed to be important for establishing a high hexose:sucrose ratio, promoting cell division.

			"context": "SWEETs play a role in transmembrane sugar movement within sink tissue of Setaria, specifically in the post-phloem transport of sugars in the seed. A model is proposed for their function in seeds in Fig. 7. The relatively stable hexose:sucrose ratio throughout grain development, and the unremarkable changes in developmental expression of genes encoding SWEETs, HXTs, or SUTs together suggest that the post-phloem pathway is uncharacteristic of other cereals. The predominant expression of SWEET4 in sinks rather than source tissue of Setaria (see) supports a role for this transporter in these pathways of monocots. Localization of SvSWEET4 proteins to a range of symplastically isolated filial cells, the vasculature of the seed, and xylem parenchyma of the stem supports this hypothesis. Moreover, the demonstration that SvSWEET4a is an exceptionally high-capacity, low-affinity transporter of glucose and sucrose is consistent with the high sugar fluxes required to support accumulation of carbohydrate in seed and stem tissues of cereals. These findings presented in S. viridis on SWEET4 highlight the need to expand research into cereal crops beyond maize and rice to better understand the post-phloem pathway influencing sink capacity and yield."

			"context": "Changes in the glucose:sucrose ratio are important for the development of both dicot and monocot seeds (Weschke et al.,). In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

A model is proposed for their function in seeds in Fig. 7. The relatively stable hexose:sucrose ratio throughout grain development, and the unremarkable changes in developmental expression of genes encoding SWEETs, HXTs, or SUTs together suggest that the post-phloem pathway is uncharacteristic of other cereals. The predominant expression of SWEET4 in sinks rather than source tissue of Setaria (see) supports a role for this transporter in these pathways of monocots. Localization of SvSWEET4 proteins to a range of symplastically isolated filial cells, the vasculature of the seed, and xylem parenchyma of the stem supports this hypothesis. Moreover, the demonstration that SvSWEET4a is an exceptionally high-capacity, low-affinity transporter of glucose and sucrose is consistent with the high sugar fluxes required to support accumulation of carbohydrate in seed and stem tissues of cereals. These findings presented in S. viridis on SWEET4 highlight the need to expand research into cereal crops beyond maize and rice to better understand the post-phloem pathway influencing sink capacity and yield."

			"context": "Highly invaginated transfer cells, indicative of a region where a high level of nutrient flux must occur, are almost always seen in the filial tissues at the maternal-filial interface, and these are present in Setaria seeds (Fig. 2E, F, I; Supplementary Fig. S8A). SWEET4 protein abundantly decorated the membranes of these cells, suggestive of a role in high-capacity transport of glucose and/or sucrose at this interface to support the growing embryo and starchy endosperm of cereals. It was not possible to determine any 'sidedness' of expression which would help to determine whether SWEET4 was importing sugar into these cells down a gradient from the placental pad apoplast or facilitating transport between transfer cells and the underlying filial cell layers (Fig. 7D). In species such as wheat, barley, and rice, uptake of sucrose from the apoplast by the aleurone/modified aleurone layer is catalysed by the active transporter SUT1 during grain filling, suggesting that the latter option may be the case. Since SWEET4 can transport both glucose and sucrose, cell-specific sugar composition and sugar gradient measurements would be useful in delineating the mechanism of post-phloem sugar transport in this seed. Unfortunately, literature is scarce on carbohydrates measured within specific structures of the seed. Where there is a marked endosperm cavity, such as wheat, careful and laborious use of aphid stylet exudates suggested that the major sugar in this tissue is sucrose and there is a 10-fold gradient from the phloem sieve tubes to the endosperm cavity. However, in the placental sac of sorghum, it was shown that hexoses would reach up to 40 g l-1 in different varieties of sorghum with <10 g l-1 of sucrose. These sugar amounts equate to sugar concentrations of ~220 mM for glucose and 30 mM for sucrose; Km values obtained here for SWEET4 were 366 mM for glucose and 1.4 M for sucrose, considerably higher than the sugar content reported in the sorghum placental sac. Higher amounts of hexoses within the placental pad, well below the Km of SWEET4 for glucose, and the affinity for sucrose relative to measured amount might suggest that SvSWEET4a predominantly exports hexoses at the transfer aleurone interface for it to reach the endosperm."

			"context": "SWEETs play a role in transmembrane sugar movement within sink tissue of Setaria, specifically in the post-phloem transport of sugars in the seed. A model is proposed for their function in seeds in Fig. 7. The relatively stable hexose:sucrose ratio throughout grain development, and the unremarkable changes in developmental expression of genes encoding SWEETs, HXTs, or SUTs together suggest that the post-phloem pathway is uncharacteristic of other cereals. The predominant expression of SWEET4 in sinks rather than source tissue of Setaria (see) supports a role for this transporter in these pathways of monocots. Localization of SvSWEET4 proteins to a range of symplastically isolated filial cells, the vasculature of the seed, and xylem parenchyma of the stem supports this hypothesis. Moreover, the demonstration that SvSWEET4a is an exceptionally high-capacity, low-affinity transporter of glucose and sucrose is consistent with the high sugar fluxes required to support accumulation of carbohydrate in seed and stem tissues of cereals. These findings presented in S. viridis on SWEET4 highlight the need to expand research into cereal crops beyond maize and rice to better understand the post-phloem pathway influencing sink capacity and yield."

			"context": "In the developing seeds of all higher plants, filial cells are symplastically isolated from the maternal tissue supplying photosynthate to the reproductive structure. Photoassimilates must be transported apoplastically, crossing several membrane barriers, a process facilitated by sugar transporters. Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEETs) have been proposed to play a crucial role in apoplastic sugar transport during phloem unloading and the post-phloem pathway in sink tissues. Evidence for this is presented here for developing seeds of the C4 model grass Setaria viridis. Using immunolocalization, SvSWEET4 was detected in various maternal and filial tissues within the seed along the sugar transport pathway, in the vascular parenchyma of the pedicel, and in the xylem parenchyma of the stem. Expression of SvSWEET4a in Xenopus laevis oocytes indicated that it functions as a high-capacity glucose and sucrose transporter. Carbohydrate and transcriptional profiling of Setaria seed heads showed that there were some developmental shifts in hexose and sucrose content and consistent expression of SvSWEET4 homologues. Collectively, these results provide evidence for the involvement of SWEETs in the apoplastic transport pathway of sink tissues and allow a pathway for post-phloem sugar transport into the seed to be proposed."

In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

			"context": "Highly invaginated transfer cells, indicative of a region where a high level of nutrient flux must occur, are almost always seen in the filial tissues at the maternal-filial interface, and these are present in Setaria seeds (Fig. 2E, F, I; Supplementary Fig. S8A). SWEET4 protein abundantly decorated the membranes of these cells, suggestive of a role in high-capacity transport of glucose and/or sucrose at this interface to support the growing embryo and starchy endosperm of cereals. It was not possible to determine any 'sidedness' of expression which would help to determine whether SWEET4 was importing sugar into these cells down a gradient from the placental pad apoplast or facilitating transport between transfer cells and the underlying filial cell layers (Fig. 7D). In species such as wheat, barley, and rice, uptake of sucrose from the apoplast by the aleurone/modified aleurone layer is catalysed by the active transporter SUT1 during grain filling, suggesting that the latter option may be the case. Since SWEET4 can transport both glucose and sucrose, cell-specific sugar composition and sugar gradient measurements would be useful in delineating the mechanism of post-phloem sugar transport in this seed. Unfortunately, literature is scarce on carbohydrates measured within specific structures of the seed. Where there is a marked endosperm cavity, such as wheat, careful and laborious use of aphid stylet exudates suggested that the major sugar in this tissue is sucrose and there is a 10-fold gradient from the phloem sieve tubes to the endosperm cavity. However, in the placental sac of sorghum, it was shown that hexoses would reach up to 40 g l-1 in different varieties of sorghum with <10 g l-1 of sucrose. These sugar amounts equate to sugar concentrations of ~220 mM for glucose and 30 mM for sucrose; Km values obtained here for SWEET4 were 366 mM for glucose and 1.4 M for sucrose, considerably higher than the sugar content reported in the sorghum placental sac. Higher amounts of hexoses within the placental pad, well below the Km of SWEET4 for glucose, and the affinity for sucrose relative to measured amount might suggest that SvSWEET4a predominantly exports hexoses at the transfer aleurone interface for it to reach the endosperm."

Photoassimilates must be transported apoplastically, crossing several membrane barriers, a process facilitated by sugar transporters. Sugars Will Eventually be Exported Transporters (SWEETs) have been proposed to play a crucial role in apoplastic sugar transport during phloem unloading and the post-phloem pathway in sink tissues. Evidence for this is presented here for developing seeds of the C4 model grass Setaria viridis. Using immunolocalization, SvSWEET4 was detected in various maternal and filial tissues within the seed along the sugar transport pathway, in the vascular parenchyma of the pedicel, and in the xylem parenchyma of the stem. Expression of SvSWEET4a in Xenopus laevis oocytes indicated that it functions as a high-capacity glucose and sucrose transporter. Carbohydrate and transcriptional profiling of Setaria seed heads showed that there were some developmental shifts in hexose and sucrose content and consistent expression of SvSWEET4 homologues. Collectively, these results provide evidence for the involvement of SWEETs in the apoplastic transport pathway of sink tissues and allow a pathway for post-phloem sugar transport into the seed to be proposed."

No direct relationship between glucose and grain development duration is explicitly stated or strongly implied.",
			"context": "Changes in the glucose:sucrose ratio are important for the development of both dicot and monocot seeds (Weschke et al.,). In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

Following anthesis, the seed or grain becomes the predominant sink for carbohydrates, especially in monocots. Generally, in crop seeds, sugars are unloaded symplastically via plasmodesmatal connections between one or more maternal cells and the phloem before entering the apoplast surrounding filial tissues. In developing seeds, filial tissue, such as the embryo and endosperm, is symplastically isolated from maternal tissues such as the seed coat and nucellar cells soon after fertilization. Subsequently, to support the growth and development of the embryo and the large endosperm in monocots, sugars must be transferred via an apoplastic pathway across plasma membranes, thus requiring membrane-localized sugar transporters. Transporters must facilitate not only the export of sugars from the maternal cells into the apoplast but also subsequent uptake into the filial cells."

SWEET4 protein abundantly decorated the membranes of these cells, suggestive of a role in high-capacity transport of glucose and/or sucrose at this interface to support the growing embryo and starchy endosperm of cereals. It was not possible to determine any 'sidedness' of expression which would help to determine whether SWEET4 was importing sugar into these cells down a gradient from the placental pad apoplast or facilitating transport between transfer cells and the underlying filial cell layers (Fig. 7D). In species such as wheat, barley, and rice, uptake of sucrose from the apoplast by the aleurone/modified aleurone layer is catalysed by the active transporter SUT1 during grain filling, suggesting that the latter option may be the case. Since SWEET4 can transport both glucose and sucrose, cell-specific sugar composition and sugar gradient measurements would be useful in delineating the mechanism of post-phloem sugar transport in this seed. Unfortunately, literature is scarce on carbohydrates measured within specific structures of the seed. Where there is a marked endosperm cavity, such as wheat, careful and laborious use of aphid stylet exudates suggested that the major sugar in this tissue is sucrose and there is a 10-fold gradient from the phloem sieve tubes to the endosperm cavity. However, in the placental sac of sorghum, it was shown that hexoses would reach up to 40 g l-1 in different varieties of sorghum with <10 g l-1 of sucrose. These sugar amounts equate to sugar concentrations of ~220 mM for glucose and 30 mM for sucrose; Km values obtained here for SWEET4 were 366 mM for glucose and 1.4 M for sucrose, considerably higher than the sugar content reported in the sorghum placental sac. Higher amounts of hexoses within the placental pad, well below the Km of SWEET4 for glucose, and the affinity for sucrose relative to measured amount might suggest that SvSWEET4a predominantly exports hexoses at the transfer aleurone interface for it to reach the endosperm."

			"context": "SWEETs play a role in transmembrane sugar movement within sink tissue of Setaria, specifically in the post-phloem transport of sugars in the seed. A model is proposed for their function in seeds in Fig. 7. The relatively stable hexose:sucrose ratio throughout grain development, and the unremarkable changes in developmental expression of genes encoding SWEETs, HXTs, or SUTs together suggest that the post-phloem pathway is uncharacteristic of other cereals. The predominant expression of SWEET4 in sinks rather than source tissue of Setaria (see) supports a role for this transporter in these pathways of monocots. Localization of SvSWEET4 proteins to a range of symplastically isolated filial cells, the vasculature of the seed, and xylem parenchyma of the stem supports this hypothesis. Moreover, the demonstration that SvSWEET4a is an exceptionally high-capacity, low-affinity transporter of glucose and sucrose is consistent with the high sugar fluxes required to support accumulation of carbohydrate in seed and stem tissues of cereals. These findings presented in S. viridis on SWEET4 highlight the need to expand research into cereal crops beyond maize and rice to better understand the post-phloem pathway influencing sink capacity and yield."

The dominant sugars present in the reproductive structure will have a bearing on the nature and properties of sugar transporters required for apoplastic sugar movement, and these have been correlated with expression levels of sugar transporters in cereal crop grains. As these processes have not been characterized in Setaria, sugar and starch content during seed development was quantified in seed heads from four developmental stages: 50% seed head emergence, anthesis, 8 DAA, and 16 DAA. Seed heads were sampled from the widely studied genetic model known as the A.10 ecotype and from the ME034V ecotype (Fig. 5; Supplementary Figs S1, S9), which is more amenable to genetic transformation. Setaria seeds and millets in general have many small seeds compared with other cereals such as sorghum, maize, and rice; therefore, harvesting single seeds from an inflorescence was impractical and data shown are from whole seed heads (Fig. 5)."

Setaria viridis (Green foxtail), a small, closely related, easily transformable relative with a small sequenced genome, is becoming a widely used genetic model for functional genomics and genetics in millets. Despite the importance of millets, the pathway of post-phloem sugar movement in their grains is poorly characterized. Here we seek to understand the role SWEETs might play in phloem unloading and the post-phloem pathway during seed development and filling in S. viridis (Setaria). Previous literature has seen a trend in SWEET4 orthologues being expressed predominantly in sinks such as stems and/or seeds of sorghum, rice, maize, sugarcane, and Setaria, suggesting a role in phloem unloading or the steps immediately following this. Here SWEET4a from S. viridis is examined with a particular focus on the seed head using a combination of immunohistochemistry, functional characterization, major carbohydrate profiling, and expression analyses. These results expand our understanding of SWEETs in the phloem unloading and post-phloem pathway of C4 grasses, and the data are used to propose a pathway for sugar movement from the phloem to the endosperm tissue of Setaria seeds."

			"context": "In the well-studied cereals rice, wheat, barley, and maize, there are defined changes in carbohydrate composition of grains during post-anthesis development as the tissue transitions from cell division and expansion to starch synthesis and grain 'filling'. The dominant sugars present in the reproductive structure will have a bearing on the nature and properties of sugar transporters required for apoplastic sugar movement, and these have been correlated with expression levels of sugar transporters in cereal crop grains. As these processes have not been characterized in Setaria, sugar and starch content during seed development was quantified in seed heads from four developmental stages: 50% seed head emergence, anthesis, 8 DAA, and 16 DAA. Seed heads were sampled from the widely studied genetic model known as the A.10 ecotype and from the ME034V ecotype (Fig. 5; Supplementary Figs S1, S9), which is more amenable to genetic transformation. Setaria seeds and millets in general have many small seeds compared with other cereals such as sorghum, maize, and rice; therefore, harvesting single seeds from an inflorescence was impractical and data shown are from whole seed heads (Fig. 5)."

			"context": "The partitioning of photoassimilates between the vegetative tissues and the agronomically valuable grain has a large impact on yield. Following anthesis, the seed or grain becomes the predominant sink for carbohydrates, especially in monocots. Generally, in crop seeds, sugars are unloaded symplastically via plasmodesmatal connections between one or more maternal cells and the phloem before entering the apoplast surrounding filial tissues. In developing seeds, filial tissue, such as the embryo and endosperm, is symplastically isolated from maternal tissues such as the seed coat and nucellar cells soon after fertilization. Subsequently, to support the growth and development of the embryo and the large endosperm in monocots, sugars must be transferred via an apoplastic pathway across plasma membranes, thus requiring membrane-localized sugar transporters. Transporters must facilitate not only the export of sugars from the maternal cells into the apoplast but also subsequent uptake into the filial cells."

Oocyte lysates were treated with or without the reducing agents DTT and beta-mercaptoethanol to test for dimerization. For recombinant protein expressed in oocytes, the monomer form at ~20 kDa was present regardless of whether reducing agents were added. There was no cross-reactivity with non-expressing, SvSWEET13a or SvSWEET13b oocyte lysate. Having established functional and SvSWEET4-specific antiserum using in vitro assays, SvSWEET4 antiserum was also tested on total plant protein extracts from the leaf, stem, and seed head for specificity (Fig. 1B). Purified Rubisco large subunit (RbcL) from rice (94.1% similarity to Setaria) was used as a control for cross-reactivity. SvSWEET4 was detected as a putative dimer at ~55 kDa. This is in accord with the predicted monomer size of SvSWEET4 orthologues of ~27 kDa, and dimerization of SvSWEET4 proteins is consistent with previous studies on the structural analysis of eukaryotic SWEETs. The SvSWEET4 dimer recognized from plant tissue has the same approximate size as RbcL (~50-55 kDa). Given the abundance of this protein in all green tissues, to rule out the possibility that SWEET4 antiserum was cross-reacting with RbcL, further testing was conducted. The same membrane used in Fig. 1B was probed again but using RbcL antiserum derived from peptides made to the tobacco RbcL to ensure the SvSWEET4 antiserum was not cross-reacting with Rubsico (Fig. 1C). The leaf tissue and purified rice RbcL samples gave a strong signal, as expected, when probed with the RbcL antiserum (Fig. 1C, D), but a very weak signal when probed with the SvSWEET4 antiserum (Fig. 1B). Conversely, the sink tissues comprising stem and the seed head, which showed a strong signal with SWEET4 antiserum, resulted in very weak signals when protein was probed with the RbcL antiserum (Fig. 1C). Cumulatively these results demonstrate that the SvSWEET4 antiserum is not cross-reacting with Rubisco and is specific for SvSWEET4 proteins."

This was tested for specificity for SvSWEET4 against total protein extracts from Xenopus oocytes expressing SvSWEET4a, SvSWEETT13a, or SvSWEET13b (A) and total plant protein extracts from Setaria (B-D). In (A) the exclusion or addition (-/+) of reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT) and beta-mercaptoethanol (betaME) is indicated above the blot. The lysates from non-expressing (ne), SvSWEET13a-, and SvSWEET13b-expressing oocytes were used as negative controls. Recombinant protein was isolated and loaded from 20 Xenopus oocytes. Total plant extracts from the leaf (L), stem (St), and seed head (SH) were pooled from 12 Setaria plants harvested at 50% seed head emergence stage and 10 microg of protein was loaded. Purified Rubisco large subunit (RbP) from rice was used as a control and 4 microg was loaded. (A), (B), and (D) used electrochemiluminescence (ECL) to detect the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary antibody conjugate. (C) The membrane from (B) probed for the Rubisco large subunit (RbcL) using antiserum derived from tobacco RbcL peptides and the use of the AttoPhos substrate system to detect alkaline phosphatase (AP) secondary antibody conjugate. RbcL was probed for using a separate membrane in (D) using the same method as in (B). Molecular weight standards (kDa) are indicated to the left of each blot. Uncropped immunoblots are shown in Supplementary Fig. S6."

Oocyte lysates were treated with or without the reducing agents DTT and beta-mercaptoethanol to test for dimerization. For recombinant protein expressed in oocytes, the monomer form at ~20 kDa was present regardless of whether reducing agents were added. There was no cross-reactivity with non-expressing, SvSWEET13a or SvSWEET13b oocyte lysate. Having established functional and SvSWEET4-specific antiserum using in vitro assays, SvSWEET4 antiserum was also tested on total plant protein extracts from the leaf, stem, and seed head for specificity (Fig. 1B). Purified Rubisco large subunit (RbcL) from rice (94.1% similarity to Setaria) was used as a control for cross-reactivity. SvSWEET4 was detected as a putative dimer at ~55 kDa.

The SvSWEET4 dimer recognized from plant tissue has the same approximate size as RbcL (~50-55 kDa). Given the abundance of this protein in all green tissues, to rule out the possibility that SWEET4 antiserum was cross-reacting with RbcL, further testing was conducted. The same membrane used in Fig. 1B was probed again but using RbcL antiserum derived from peptides made to the tobacco RbcL to ensure the SvSWEET4 antiserum was not cross-reacting with Rubsico (Fig. 1C). The leaf tissue and purified rice RbcL samples gave a strong signal, as expected, when probed with the RbcL antiserum (Fig. 1C, D), but a very weak signal when probed with the SvSWEET4 antiserum (Fig. 1B). Conversely, the sink tissues comprising stem and the seed head, which showed a strong signal with SWEET4 antiserum, resulted in very weak signals when protein was probed with the RbcL antiserum (Fig. 1C). Cumulatively these results demonstrate that the SvSWEET4 antiserum is not cross-reacting with Rubisco and is specific for SvSWEET4 proteins."

Uncropped immunoblots are shown in Supplementary Fig. S6.\nThe specificity of the antiserum for SvSWEET4 was tested using total protein extracts from Xenopus oocytes, expressing recombinant SvSWEET4a, SvSWEET13a, and SvSWEET13b, or Setaria tissue (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S6). Oocyte lysates were treated with or without the reducing agents DTT and beta-mercaptoethanol to test for dimerization. For recombinant protein expressed in oocytes, the monomer form at ~20 kDa was present regardless of whether reducing agents were added. There was no cross-reactivity with non-expressing, SvSWEET13a or SvSWEET13b oocyte lysate. Having established functional and SvSWEET4-specific antiserum using in vitro assays, SvSWEET4 antiserum was also tested on total plant protein extracts from the leaf, stem, and seed head for specificity (Fig. 1B). Purified Rubisco large subunit (RbcL) from rice (94.1% similarity to Setaria) was used as a control for cross-reactivity. SvSWEET4 was detected as a putative dimer at ~55 kDa. This is in accord with the predicted monomer size of SvSWEET4 orthologues of ~27 kDa, and dimerization of SvSWEET4 proteins is consistent with previous studies on the structural analysis of eukaryotic SWEETs. The SvSWEET4 dimer recognized from plant tissue has the same approximate size as RbcL (~50-55 kDa). Given the abundance of this protein in all green tissues, to rule out the possibility that SWEET4 antiserum was cross-reacting with RbcL, further testing was conducted. The same membrane used in Fig. 1B was probed again but using RbcL antiserum derived from peptides made to the tobacco RbcL to ensure the SvSWEET4 antiserum was not cross-reacting with Rubsico (Fig. 1C). The leaf tissue and purified rice RbcL samples gave a strong signal, as expected, when probed with the RbcL antiserum (Fig. 1C, D), but a very weak signal when probed with the SvSWEET4 antiserum (Fig. 1B). Conversely, the sink tissues comprising stem and the seed head, which showed a strong signal with SWEET4 antiserum, resulted in very weak signals when protein was probed with the RbcL antiserum (Fig. 1C). Cumulatively these results demonstrate that the SvSWEET4 antiserum is not cross-reacting with Rubisco and is specific for SvSWEET4 proteins."

Oocyte lysates were treated with or without the reducing agents DTT and beta-mercaptoethanol to test for dimerization. For recombinant protein expressed in oocytes, the monomer form at ~20 kDa was present regardless of whether reducing agents were added. There was no cross-reactivity with non-expressing, SvSWEET13a or SvSWEET13b oocyte lysate. Having established functional and SvSWEET4-specific antiserum using in vitro assays, SvSWEET4 antiserum was also tested on total plant protein extracts from the leaf, stem, and seed head for specificity (Fig. 1B). Purified Rubisco large subunit (RbcL) from rice (94.1% similarity to Setaria) was used as a control for cross-reactivity. SvSWEET4 was detected as a putative dimer at ~55 kDa. This is in accord with the predicted monomer size of SvSWEET4 orthologues of ~27 kDa, and dimerization of SvSWEET4 proteins is consistent with previous studies on the structural analysis of eukaryotic SWEETs. The SvSWEET4 dimer recognized from plant tissue has the same approximate size as RbcL (~50-55 kDa). Given the abundance of this protein in all green tissues, to rule out the possibility that SWEET4 antiserum was cross-reacting with RbcL, further testing was conducted. The same membrane used in Fig. 1B was probed again but using RbcL antiserum derived from peptides made to the tobacco RbcL to ensure the SvSWEET4 antiserum was not cross-reacting with Rubsico (Fig. 1C). The leaf tissue and purified rice RbcL samples gave a strong signal, as expected, when probed with the RbcL antiserum (Fig. 1C, D), but a very weak signal when probed with the SvSWEET4 antiserum (Fig. 1B). Conversely, the sink tissues comprising stem and the seed head, which showed a strong signal with SWEET4 antiserum, resulted in very weak signals when protein was probed with the RbcL antiserum (Fig. 1C). Cumulatively these results demonstrate that the SvSWEET4 antiserum is not cross-reacting with Rubisco and is specific for SvSWEET4 proteins.\nValidation of SvSWEET4 antiserum using immunoblotting. Commercially generated affinity-purified antiserum was raised against peptides derived from the SvSWEET4a protein isoform (see Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). This was tested for specificity for SvSWEET4 against total protein extracts from Xenopus oocytes expressing SvSWEET4a, SvSWEETT13a, or SvSWEET13b (A) and total plant protein extracts from Setaria (B-D). In (A) the exclusion or addition (-/+) of reducing agents dithiothreitol (DTT) and beta-mercaptoethanol (betaME) is indicated above the blot. The lysates from non-expressing (ne), SvSWEET13a-, and SvSWEET13b-expressing oocytes were used as negative controls. Recombinant protein was isolated and loaded from 20 Xenopus oocytes. Total plant extracts from the leaf (L), stem (St), and seed head (SH) were pooled from 12 Setaria plants harvested at 50% seed head emergence stage and 10 microg of protein was loaded. Purified Rubisco large subunit (RbP) from rice was used as a control and 4 microg was loaded. (A), (B), and (D) used electrochemiluminescence (ECL) to detect the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary antibody conjugate.

			"context": "Changes in the glucose:sucrose ratio are important for the development of both dicot and monocot seeds (Weschke et al.,). In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

Genes encoding a vacuolar invertase (Sevir.1G004700) were abundant at anthesis. Neutral invertase (Sevir.1G193400) was expressed throughout development. Expression of SuSy, one of the most common sink-localized, cytosolic sucrolytic enzymes, was highly expressed from 8 DAA. Genes encoding proteins involved in sucrose synthesis, UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UDP-glc PPase), sucrose phosphatase (SPP), and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), were generally ubiquitously expressed throughout development. The most abundantly expressed genes encoded ADP-glc PPase, starch synthase (SS), and starch branching enzyme (SBE), all of which are involved in starch synthesis, and up-regulated during maturation stages from 8 DAA. Notably, genes encoding the starch degradation enzyme glucosidase was expressed at the earlier stages (Sevir.2G265100) or throughout development (Sevir9G124300).\n SuSy was constantly expressed at high levels, and a peak in expression was not evident coincident with the breakdown of sucrose within filial cells to fuel starch biosynthesis. Genes of cell wall invertase were expressed at moderate levels throughout development (Supplementary Fig. S10). Apart from sampling effects, the stable expression of these genes could also be related to different post-translational regulation compared with cereals such as maize where these changes are more marked. Transcripts encoding a vacuolar invertase (Sevir.1G004700) were also detected at relatively high levels, presumably catalysing sucrose breakdown for temporary vacuolar storage (Fig. 6). This gene might also be a sucrose:(sucrose/fructan) 6-fructosyltransferase (SST or SFT), which is involved in the transferal of a fructosyl group from sucrose to various acceptors in fructan synthesis. The nucleotide sequence similarity between invertases and SST/SFTs makes it difficult to distinguish the two. Phyre2 homology-based protein modelling suggested that the Setaria sequence probably encoded an SST or SFT. This would correlate with the unexpected accumulation of fructans within the seed head at all stages sampled (Fig. 5A). The accumulation of fructans in Setaria might be physiologically relevant for maintaining a concentration gradient of sucrose between the phloem and sink tissue while minimizing the accumulation of osmotically active solutes for development and starch accumulation (Fig. 5D)."

			"context": "Changes in the glucose:sucrose ratio are important for the development of both dicot and monocot seeds (Weschke et al.,). In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

Genes of cell wall invertase were expressed at moderate levels throughout development (Supplementary Fig. S10). Apart from sampling effects, the stable expression of these genes could also be related to different post-translational regulation compared with cereals such as maize where these changes are more marked. Transcripts encoding a vacuolar invertase (Sevir.1G004700) were also detected at relatively high levels, presumably catalysing sucrose breakdown for temporary vacuolar storage (Fig. 6). This gene might also be a sucrose:(sucrose/fructan) 6-fructosyltransferase (SST or SFT), which is involved in the transferal of a fructosyl group from sucrose to various acceptors in fructan synthesis. The nucleotide sequence similarity between invertases and SST/SFTs makes it difficult to distinguish the two. Phyre2 homology-based protein modelling suggested that the Setaria sequence probably encoded an SST or SFT. This would correlate with the unexpected accumulation of fructans within the seed head at all stages sampled (Fig. 5A). The accumulation of fructans in Setaria might be physiologically relevant for maintaining a concentration gradient of sucrose between the phloem and sink tissue while minimizing the accumulation of osmotically active solutes for development and starch accumulation (Fig. 5D)."

			"context": "Glucose content remained relatively unchanged (20-25 micromol g-1 FW) during seed head development in A.10 with no significant differences between stages (Fig. 5A). Fructose centent increased from 50% seed head emergence to anthesis, where it subsequently halved (significantly) at 8 DAA. Sucrose content fluctuated throughout development between 4 micromol g-1 FW and 6 micromol g-1 FW in the first two stages harvested and then significantly increased from anthesis to 8 DAA, later decreasing to ~3.8 micromol g-1 FW at 16 DAA. Fructans were also present in A.10 seed heads, increasing ~1.6-fold from anthesis to 16 DAA. Total soluble sugars did not change significantly through the course of seed development (Fig. 5B). To examine whether a shift from high hexose to high sucrose was apparent, as has been observed during grain development in other species, the hexose:sucrose ratio was examined throughout development (Fig. 5C). There was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio between anthesis and 8 DAA; however, this increased again at 16 DAA in A.10. From 8 DAA there was a large increase in starch accumulation (~13.8-fold compared with anthesis) (Fig. 5D). Starch content further increased, significantly (~4.1-fold) between 8 and 16 DAA. Although A.10 and ME034V ecotypes mostly exhibited the same carbohydrate content measured, there were some differences in the glucose and sucrose amounts and thus the hexose:sucrose ratio (Supplementary Fig. S9)."

			"context": "Changes in the glucose:sucrose ratio are important for the development of both dicot and monocot seeds (Weschke et al.,). In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

SuSy activity in maize increases during seed maturation as rates of carbohydrate accumulation peak. This was not apparent in Setaria where SuSy transcripts remained relatively high and unchanged throughout development (Fig. 6). In maize, mutants with defective SuSy and cell wall invertase were shown to have a shrunken seed phenotype. Cell wall invertase has been thought to be important for mitotic cell division whilst SuSy breaks down sucrose to provide the substrates necessary for starch synthesis. In these mutational studies, the possibility that both these enzymes are important at all stages of seed development cannot be ruled out as the proteins are absent from all tissue types in the seed of these mutants from germination to desiccation and the phenotype in both cases is shrunken, unfilled seeds. In rice and barley, both C3 grasses, cell wall invertase is also expressed early in seed development and proposed to be important for establishing a high hexose:sucrose ratio, promoting cell division. Setaria seed did not exhibit these correlations between sugar species, sucrolytic enzyme levels, and patterns of development, which might indicate that this sugar signal is not integral to the control of seed development in this plant species."

These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6).

This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

The nucleotide sequence similarity between invertases and SST/SFTs makes it difficult to distinguish the two. Phyre2 homology-based protein modelling suggested that the Setaria sequence probably encoded an SST or SFT. This would correlate with the unexpected accumulation of fructans within the seed head at all stages sampled (Fig. 5A).

			"context": "Glucose content remained relatively unchanged (20-25 micromol g-1 FW) during seed head development in A.10 with no significant differences between stages (Fig. 5A). Fructose centent increased from 50% seed head emergence to anthesis, where it subsequently halved (significantly) at 8 DAA. Sucrose content fluctuated throughout development between 4 micromol g-1 FW and 6 micromol g-1 FW in the first two stages harvested and then significantly increased from anthesis to 8 DAA, later decreasing to ~3.8 micromol g-1 FW at 16 DAA. Fructans were also present in A.10 seed heads, increasing ~1.6-fold from anthesis to 16 DAA. Total soluble sugars did not change significantly through the course of seed development (Fig. 5B). To examine whether a shift from high hexose to high sucrose was apparent, as has been observed during grain development in other species, the hexose:sucrose ratio was examined throughout development (Fig. 5C). There was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio between anthesis and 8 DAA; however, this increased again at 16 DAA in A.10. From 8 DAA there was a large increase in starch accumulation (~13.8-fold compared with anthesis) (Fig. 5D). Starch content further increased, significantly (~4.1-fold) between 8 and 16 DAA. Although A.10 and ME034V ecotypes mostly exhibited the same carbohydrate content measured, there were some differences in the glucose and sucrose amounts and thus the hexose:sucrose ratio (Supplementary Fig. S9)."

In maize, zmsweet4c and miniature1 mutants have both been shown to exhibit an impaired seed filling phenotype and lack a fully differentiated basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL), the latter of which has a gene knockout that usually encodes a cell wall invertase specific to the endosperm. Mutational analysis commonly produces developmental disruptions resulting in aberrant tissue structures, confounding the interpretation of the phenotypes observed because the lack of gene expression could have disrupted transport at any stage of development. Thus, genetic studies provide limited developmental stage-specific information on the role of SWEETs in grain development and do not provide the spatial information on the physical location of these proteins within the reproductive structures needed to support a model of sugar movement. The broad developmental expression of ZmSWEET4 orthologues (Supplementary Fig. S12) makes this issue even more important as a knockout could have a multitude of effects during development at any stage from fertilization to grain filling."

This suggests that SWEET4 participates early in the phloem unloading pathway or in the immediate steps in the post-phloem pathway (Figs 2A, D, G; 3A; Supplementary Fig. S7). These cells in the vasculature are likely to be parenchyma cells, as was observed in the stem, where localization appeared to be more specifically at the xylem parenchyma (Fig. 3C-E). Prior to the discovery of SWEETs, it was shown in the maize pedicel tissue that photoassimilates were exported from the cells into the apoplast but it was unknown how this occurred. Solutes might move symplastically down a concentration gradient into parenchyma cells and subsequently be unloaded into the apoplast by SvSWEET4 (Fig. 7B). This would be consistent with the high Km of SvSWEET4a for sucrose reported here, which is of the same order as the sucrose concentration present in the phloem (~1 M). Sugars can then be utilized for storage elsewhere or used in synthesis of structural carbohydrates, for example in sclerenchyma cells immediately adjacent to the site of unloading (Figs 2G, 3A-E; Supplementary Fig. S7A-E). Interestingly, the localization pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma was atypical of localization to the plasma membrane and possibly more reminiscent of detection in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi body. These organelles are essential for facilitating the transfer of sugars to proteins, lipids, proteoglycans, and polysaccharides of the plant cell wall. Consequently, SvSWEET4 could aid in this process given it was found in highly lignified tissue structures of the stem and pedicel (Figs 2, 3). In legumes, xylem parenchyma transfer cells have been observed within the stem, so there is a possibility that SvSWEET4 is located on highly invaginated transfer cells of the stem and pedicel where large fluxes of solutes must occur. In Arabidopsis, AtSWEET9 has previously been shown to localize to the plasma membrane, the trans-Golgi apparatus, and multivesicular bodies, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SWEET fusions. SvSWEET4 could load vesicles with sugars for exo- or endocytosis or export sugars from the vesicles depending on the sugar gradient. In the rice leaf blade, vesicles have been observed within the xylem parenchyma cells where endocytosis might occur for xylem sap retrieval from the apoplast. In plants it has been postulated that photoassimilate uptake can also be mediated by endocytosis and is perhaps sucrose induced, although this has not yet been shown in planta. The immunodetection pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma of stems might provide the first line of evidence for this within the plant."

This suggests that SWEET4 participates early in the phloem unloading pathway or in the immediate steps in the post-phloem pathway (Figs 2A, D, G; 3A; Supplementary Fig. S7). These cells in the vasculature are likely to be parenchyma cells, as was observed in the stem, where localization appeared to be more specifically at the xylem parenchyma (Fig. 3C-E). Prior to the discovery of SWEETs, it was shown in the maize pedicel tissue that photoassimilates were exported from the cells into the apoplast but it was unknown how this occurred. Solutes might move symplastically down a concentration gradient into parenchyma cells and subsequently be unloaded into the apoplast by SvSWEET4 (Fig. 7B). This would be consistent with the high Km of SvSWEET4a for sucrose reported here, which is of the same order as the sucrose concentration present in the phloem (~1 M). Sugars can then be utilized for storage elsewhere or used in synthesis of structural carbohydrates, for example in sclerenchyma cells immediately adjacent to the site of unloading (Figs 2G, 3A-E; Supplementary Fig. S7A-E). Interestingly, the localization pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma was atypical of localization to the plasma membrane and possibly more reminiscent of detection in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi body. These organelles are essential for facilitating the transfer of sugars to proteins, lipids, proteoglycans, and polysaccharides of the plant cell wall. Consequently, SvSWEET4 could aid in this process given it was found in highly lignified tissue structures of the stem and pedicel (Figs 2, 3). In legumes, xylem parenchyma transfer cells have been observed within the stem, so there is a possibility that SvSWEET4 is located on highly invaginated transfer cells of the stem and pedicel where large fluxes of solutes must occur. In Arabidopsis, AtSWEET9 has previously been shown to localize to the plasma membrane, the trans-Golgi apparatus, and multivesicular bodies, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SWEET fusions. SvSWEET4 could load vesicles with sugars for exo- or endocytosis or export sugars from the vesicles depending on the sugar gradient. In the rice leaf blade, vesicles have been observed within the xylem parenchyma cells where endocytosis might occur for xylem sap retrieval from the apoplast. In plants it has been postulated that photoassimilate uptake can also be mediated by endocytosis and is perhaps sucrose induced, although this has not yet been shown in planta. The immunodetection pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma of stems might provide the first line of evidence for this within the plant."

This suggests that SWEET4 participates early in the phloem unloading pathway or in the immediate steps in the post-phloem pathway (Figs 2A, D, G; 3A; Supplementary Fig. S7). These cells in the vasculature are likely to be parenchyma cells, as was observed in the stem, where localization appeared to be more specifically at the xylem parenchyma (Fig. 3C-E). Prior to the discovery of SWEETs, it was shown in the maize pedicel tissue that photoassimilates were exported from the cells into the apoplast but it was unknown how this occurred. Solutes might move symplastically down a concentration gradient into parenchyma cells and subsequently be unloaded into the apoplast by SvSWEET4 (Fig. 7B). This would be consistent with the high Km of SvSWEET4a for sucrose reported here, which is of the same order as the sucrose concentration present in the phloem (~1 M). Sugars can then be utilized for storage elsewhere or used in synthesis of structural carbohydrates, for example in sclerenchyma cells immediately adjacent to the site of unloading (Figs 2G, 3A-E; Supplementary Fig. S7A-E). Interestingly, the localization pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma was atypical of localization to the plasma membrane and possibly more reminiscent of detection in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi body. These organelles are essential for facilitating the transfer of sugars to proteins, lipids, proteoglycans, and polysaccharides of the plant cell wall. Consequently, SvSWEET4 could aid in this process given it was found in highly lignified tissue structures of the stem and pedicel (Figs 2, 3). In legumes, xylem parenchyma transfer cells have been observed within the stem, so there is a possibility that SvSWEET4 is located on highly invaginated transfer cells of the stem and pedicel where large fluxes of solutes must occur. In Arabidopsis, AtSWEET9 has previously been shown to localize to the plasma membrane, the trans-Golgi apparatus, and multivesicular bodies, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SWEET fusions. SvSWEET4 could load vesicles with sugars for exo- or endocytosis or export sugars from the vesicles depending on the sugar gradient. In the rice leaf blade, vesicles have been observed within the xylem parenchyma cells where endocytosis might occur for xylem sap retrieval from the apoplast. In plants it has been postulated that photoassimilate uptake can also be mediated by endocytosis and is perhaps sucrose induced, although this has not yet been shown in planta. The immunodetection pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma of stems might provide the first line of evidence for this within the plant."

This suggests that SWEET4 participates early in the phloem unloading pathway or in the immediate steps in the post-phloem pathway (Figs 2A, D, G; 3A; Supplementary Fig. S7). These cells in the vasculature are likely to be parenchyma cells, as was observed in the stem, where localization appeared to be more specifically at the xylem parenchyma (Fig. 3C-E). Prior to the discovery of SWEETs, it was shown in the maize pedicel tissue that photoassimilates were exported from the cells into the apoplast but it was unknown how this occurred. Solutes might move symplastically down a concentration gradient into parenchyma cells and subsequently be unloaded into the apoplast by SvSWEET4 (Fig. 7B). This would be consistent with the high Km of SvSWEET4a for sucrose reported here, which is of the same order as the sucrose concentration present in the phloem (~1 M). Sugars can then be utilized for storage elsewhere or used in synthesis of structural carbohydrates, for example in sclerenchyma cells immediately adjacent to the site of unloading (Figs 2G, 3A-E; Supplementary Fig. S7A-E). Interestingly, the localization pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma was atypical of localization to the plasma membrane and possibly more reminiscent of detection in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi body. These organelles are essential for facilitating the transfer of sugars to proteins, lipids, proteoglycans, and polysaccharides of the plant cell wall. Consequently, SvSWEET4 could aid in this process given it was found in highly lignified tissue structures of the stem and pedicel (Figs 2, 3). In legumes, xylem parenchyma transfer cells have been observed within the stem, so there is a possibility that SvSWEET4 is located on highly invaginated transfer cells of the stem and pedicel where large fluxes of solutes must occur. In Arabidopsis, AtSWEET9 has previously been shown to localize to the plasma membrane, the trans-Golgi apparatus, and multivesicular bodies, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SWEET fusions. SvSWEET4 could load vesicles with sugars for exo- or endocytosis or export sugars from the vesicles depending on the sugar gradient. In the rice leaf blade, vesicles have been observed within the xylem parenchyma cells where endocytosis might occur for xylem sap retrieval from the apoplast. In plants it has been postulated that photoassimilate uptake can also be mediated by endocytosis and is perhaps sucrose induced, although this has not yet been shown in planta. The immunodetection pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma of stems might provide the first line of evidence for this within the plant."

This suggests that SWEET4 participates early in the phloem unloading pathway or in the immediate steps in the post-phloem pathway (Figs 2A, D, G; 3A; Supplementary Fig. S7). These cells in the vasculature are likely to be parenchyma cells, as was observed in the stem, where localization appeared to be more specifically at the xylem parenchyma (Fig. 3C-E). Prior to the discovery of SWEETs, it was shown in the maize pedicel tissue that photoassimilates were exported from the cells into the apoplast but it was unknown how this occurred. Solutes might move symplastically down a concentration gradient into parenchyma cells and subsequently be unloaded into the apoplast by SvSWEET4 (Fig. 7B). This would be consistent with the high Km of SvSWEET4a for sucrose reported here, which is of the same order as the sucrose concentration present in the phloem (~1 M). Sugars can then be utilized for storage elsewhere or used in synthesis of structural carbohydrates, for example in sclerenchyma cells immediately adjacent to the site of unloading (Figs 2G, 3A-E; Supplementary Fig. S7A-E). Interestingly, the localization pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma was atypical of localization to the plasma membrane and possibly more reminiscent of detection in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi body. These organelles are essential for facilitating the transfer of sugars to proteins, lipids, proteoglycans, and polysaccharides of the plant cell wall. Consequently, SvSWEET4 could aid in this process given it was found in highly lignified tissue structures of the stem and pedicel (Figs 2, 3). In legumes, xylem parenchyma transfer cells have been observed within the stem, so there is a possibility that SvSWEET4 is located on highly invaginated transfer cells of the stem and pedicel where large fluxes of solutes must occur. In Arabidopsis, AtSWEET9 has previously been shown to localize to the plasma membrane, the trans-Golgi apparatus, and multivesicular bodies, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SWEET fusions. SvSWEET4 could load vesicles with sugars for exo- or endocytosis or export sugars from the vesicles depending on the sugar gradient.

Consequently, SvSWEET4 could aid in this process given it was found in highly lignified tissue structures of the stem and pedicel (Figs 2, 3). In legumes, xylem parenchyma transfer cells have been observed within the stem, so there is a possibility that SvSWEET4 is located on highly invaginated transfer cells of the stem and pedicel where large fluxes of solutes must occur. In Arabidopsis, AtSWEET9 has previously been shown to localize to the plasma membrane, the trans-Golgi apparatus, and multivesicular bodies, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SWEET fusions. SvSWEET4 could load vesicles with sugars for exo- or endocytosis or export sugars from the vesicles depending on the sugar gradient. In the rice leaf blade, vesicles have been observed within the xylem parenchyma cells where endocytosis might occur for xylem sap retrieval from the apoplast. In plants it has been postulated that photoassimilate uptake can also be mediated by endocytosis and is perhaps sucrose induced, although this has not yet been shown in planta. The immunodetection pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma of stems might provide the first line of evidence for this within the plant."

This suggests that SWEET4 participates early in the phloem unloading pathway or in the immediate steps in the post-phloem pathway (Figs 2A, D, G; 3A; Supplementary Fig. S7). These cells in the vasculature are likely to be parenchyma cells, as was observed in the stem, where localization appeared to be more specifically at the xylem parenchyma (Fig. 3C-E). Prior to the discovery of SWEETs, it was shown in the maize pedicel tissue that photoassimilates were exported from the cells into the apoplast but it was unknown how this occurred. Solutes might move symplastically down a concentration gradient into parenchyma cells and subsequently be unloaded into the apoplast by SvSWEET4 (Fig. 7B). This would be consistent with the high Km of SvSWEET4a for sucrose reported here, which is of the same order as the sucrose concentration present in the phloem (~1 M). Sugars can then be utilized for storage elsewhere or used in synthesis of structural carbohydrates, for example in sclerenchyma cells immediately adjacent to the site of unloading (Figs 2G, 3A-E; Supplementary Fig. S7A-E). Interestingly, the localization pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma was atypical of localization to the plasma membrane and possibly more reminiscent of detection in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi body. These organelles are essential for facilitating the transfer of sugars to proteins, lipids, proteoglycans, and polysaccharides of the plant cell wall. Consequently, SvSWEET4 could aid in this process given it was found in highly lignified tissue structures of the stem and pedicel (Figs 2, 3). In legumes, xylem parenchyma transfer cells have been observed within the stem, so there is a possibility that SvSWEET4 is located on highly invaginated transfer cells of the stem and pedicel where large fluxes of solutes must occur. In Arabidopsis, AtSWEET9 has previously been shown to localize to the plasma membrane, the trans-Golgi apparatus, and multivesicular bodies, using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-SWEET fusions. SvSWEET4 could load vesicles with sugars for exo- or endocytosis or export sugars from the vesicles depending on the sugar gradient. In the rice leaf blade, vesicles have been observed within the xylem parenchyma cells where endocytosis might occur for xylem sap retrieval from the apoplast. In plants it has been postulated that photoassimilate uptake can also be mediated by endocytosis and is perhaps sucrose induced, although this has not yet been shown in planta. The immunodetection pattern of SvSWEET4 in the xylem parenchyma of stems might provide the first line of evidence for this within the plant."

SvSWEET4 could load vesicles with sugars for exo- or endocytosis or export sugars from the vesicles depending on the sugar gradient. In the rice leaf blade, vesicles have been observed within the xylem parenchyma cells where endocytosis might occur for xylem sap retrieval from the apoplast. In plants it has been postulated that photoassimilate uptake can also be mediated by endocytosis and is perhaps sucrose induced, although this has not yet been shown in planta.

			"context": "Changes in the glucose:sucrose ratio are important for the development of both dicot and monocot seeds (Weschke et al.,). In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6). This is consistent with lower amounts of sucrose observed compared with hexoses (Fig. 5)."

In many grasses, glucose is proposed to be produced in the apoplast from the action of cell wall invertase on sucrose leaving the phloem, and this glucose is then imported into the dividing cells of the endosperm by HUTs. After cell division is complete, SuSy is highly expressed in the endosperm tissue, and sucrose itself is transported by SUTs across the aleurone and subaleurone layers of the endosperm to fuel starch synthesis. Thus, by comparing temporal expression patterns of genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism with those for sugar transporters, insights into the post-phloem transport process can be derived (Figs 5, 6). In the A.10 ecotype of Setaria studied here, there was no clear transition in sugar composition observed across the developmental stages examined, although there was a significant decrease in the hexose:sucrose ratio from anthesis to 8 DAA, but this increased again at 16 DAA as total soluble sugars decreased, and starch content increased (Fig. 5C, D). However, the ratio was still >1, indicating that there were still higher amounts of glucose at 8 and 16 DAA, and consequently developmental shifts were not a result of the perception of changes in sucrose level (Fig. 5B). This suggests that the developmental shift to starch accumulation post-anthesis in Setaria may not be a direct response to sugar or hormonal signals as in other reports and that a marked shift from hexose to sucrose transport across filial tissues may not occur. These results were similarly mirrored in the ME034V ecotype except there was a significant decrease in glucose from anthesis to 8 DAA. This ecotype was included in this study as focus has shifted in recent literature to this variety in genetic transformation studies. Sampling across more stages of development and beyond 16 DAA might serve to clarify this difference as the duration of seed development may differ between ecotypes. Moreover, the sampling of whole seed heads instead of seeds (necessary given the small seed size) may dampen hexose:sucrose shifts and relative transcript abundance. SWEET, HXT, and SUT genes were predominantly stable in their expression levels during seed development, despite the appearance of transcripts encoding metabolic enzymes involved in carbohydrate synthesis increasing with developmental age as expected (Figs 5, 6; Supplementary Figs S9, S10). The transcript abundance of AQP genes is consistent with the large flux of photoassimilates and hence water that would be required for seed filling (Figs 5, 6). Interestingly, SPP and SPS genes encoding key proteins required for sucrose synthesis were only moderately expressed throughout development (Fig. 6).

			"context": " SuSy was constantly expressed at high levels, and a peak in expression was not evident coincident with the breakdown of sucrose within filial cells to fuel starch biosynthesis. Genes of cell wall invertase were expressed at moderate levels throughout development (Supplementary Fig. S10). Apart from sampling effects, the stable expression of these genes could also be related to different post-translational regulation compared with cereals such as maize where these changes are more marked. Transcripts encoding a vacuolar invertase (Sevir.1G004700) were also detected at relatively high levels, presumably catalysing sucrose breakdown for temporary vacuolar storage (Fig. 6). This gene might also be a sucrose:(sucrose/fructan) 6-fructosyltransferase (SST or SFT), which is involved in the transferal of a fructosyl group from sucrose to various acceptors in fructan synthesis. The nucleotide sequence similarity between invertases and SST/SFTs makes it difficult to distinguish the two. Phyre2 homology-based protein modelling suggested that the Setaria sequence probably encoded an SST or SFT. This would correlate with the unexpected accumulation of fructans within the seed head at all stages sampled (Fig. 5A). The accumulation of fructans in Setaria might be physiologically relevant for maintaining a concentration gradient of sucrose between the phloem and sink tissue while minimizing the accumulation of osmotically active solutes for development and starch accumulation (Fig. 5D)."
