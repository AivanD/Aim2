In tomato fruit, alpha-tomatine is converted to esculeoside A during fruit ripening in a natural detoxification process from the plant to facilitate dispersal of the seeds by foraging animals. Unintended toxic effects of SGAs should also be taken into account when used in resistance breeding."

The antifungal and anti-insect activity of SGAs from S. commersonii is not restricted to potato pathogens and pests, but could also affect beneficial or commensal micro-organisms or other animals that feed on plants. In tomato fruit, alpha-tomatine is converted to esculeoside A during fruit ripening in a natural detoxification process from the plant to facilitate dispersal of the seeds by foraging animals. Unintended toxic effects of SGAs should also be taken into account when used in resistance breeding."

Using a bulked segregant RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq) approach, we mapped the resistance locus to the top of chromosome 12 of potato. We sequenced the genome of the resistant parent of the population and identified two glycosyltransferases (GTs) that can provide resistance to susceptible S. commersonii. We show that the resistance is based on the production of tetraose SGAs and provide in vitro evidence to show that they can be effective against other fungi besides A. solani. As SGAs can be involved in resistance against insects, we also tested if they can protect against Colorado potato beetle (CPB). Combined, our results show that the tetraose SGAs from S. commersonii have potential to provide resistance against a range of potato pathogens and pests."

			"context": "Biosynthesis of SGAs in Solanum is controlled by many genes. The discovery of S. commersonii genotypes with and without tetraose SGAs provides us with unique insight in the role of these compounds in plant immunity. Similar compounds are produced in Solanum species such as S. chacoense, S. chomatophilum, S. oplocense, S. paucisectum, and S. piurae, which may explain why these (or their descendants) display resistance to A. solani or CPB. The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato. The biosynthesis pathways leading to the production of these major SGAs from cultivated potato and tomato have largely been elucidated in recent years and it was found that the underlying genes occur in conserved clusters. This knowledge and the similarities between SGAs from S. commersonii and cultivated potato/tomato will help to identify the missing genes from the pathway through comparative genomics."

The corresponding allele from the susceptible haplotype contains a frameshift mutation, leading to a truncated protein (Figure 2:figure supplement 7). Several other short ORFs with homology to GTs were predicted in the resistant haplotype, but ScGTR1 (S. commersonii GT linked to resistance 1) and ScGTR2 are the only full-length genes in the region. Reads from the BSR-Seq experiment show that both genes are expressed in bulks of resistant progeny and not in susceptible progeny (Figure 2b), suggesting a putative role for these genes in causing resistance. ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are homologous genes with a high similarity (the predicted proteins that they encode share 97% amino acid identity). We compared the predicted amino acid sequences with previously characterised GTs and found that they share some similarity with GTs with a role in zeatin biosynthesis and with GAME17, an enzyme involved in biosynthesis of the SGA alpha-tomatine typically found in tomato (; Figure 2:figure supplement 8, Supplementary file 2)."

To see if the SGAs from S. commersonii can protect against insects as well, we performed a test with larvae of a CPB genotype collected in the Netherlands on wildtype CGN18024_1/CGN18024_3 and on CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1 or ScGTR2 (Figure 4b). Wildtype CGN18024_3 is susceptible to the CPB genotype that was tested, but CGN18024_1 and CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1 or ScGTR2 are resistant, as illustrated by a very low larvae weight and survival (Figure 4c). Thus, the conversion of triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 to tetraose SGAs produced by CGN18024_1, carried out by both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2, can provide protection against A. solani as well as CPB (Figure 4a-d)."

			"context": "To investigate a possible role for ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in the production of tetraose SGAs from CGN18024_1 and their link to resistance, we generated stable transformants of ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in triose SGA producing CGN18024_3 (Figure 4:figure supplement 1). UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4).\nData are visualised with boxplots, with horizonal lines indicating median values and individual measurements plotted on top. (a) Tetraose SGAs were detected in resistant CGN18024_1 and in CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1/ScGTR2. Susceptible S. tuberosum cv.

			"context": "To investigate a possible role for ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in the production of tetraose SGAs from CGN18024_1 and their link to resistance, we generated stable transformants of ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in triose SGA producing CGN18024_3 (Figure 4:figure supplement 1). UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4).\nData are visualised with boxplots, with horizonal lines indicating median values and individual measurements plotted on top. (a) Tetraose SGAs were detected in resistant CGN18024_1 and in CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1/ScGTR2. Susceptible S. tuberosum cv. 'Atlantic' and wildtype (WT) CGN18024_3 contain only triose SGAs. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3, resulting in a commertetraose (Gal-Glu-Glu-Glu), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose, resulting in a lycotetraose (Gal-Glu-Glu-Xyl). Each boxplot displays the data of three seperate measurements (b) WT CGN18024_1/CGN18024_3 and CGN18024_3 transformants were inoculated with Alternaria solani altNL03003. Three plants of each genotype were tested and three leaves per plants were inoculated with six 10 microl droplets with spore suspension each. Lesions diameters were measured 5 days post inoculation. Significant differences with WT CGN18024_3 are indicated with asterisks (Welch's two-sample t-test, ***p < 0.001). ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 can both complement resistance to A. solani in CGN18024_3, as the lesion sizes produced on CGN18024_3 transformants are comparable to resistant CGN18024_1. (c) Three plants per genotype were challenged with five Colorado potato beetle larvae each. The tetraose SGAs produced by ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 can provide resistance to Colorado potato beetle, as indicated by reduced larvae survival and total larvae weight. Significant differences with WT CGN18024_3 are indicated with asterisks (Welch's two-sample t-test, *p < 0.05, ***p < 0.001). (d) Putative structures of SGAs detected in CGN18024_1 and CGN18024_3, based on previous studies. CGN18024_3 produces triose SGAs and is susceptible to Colorado potato beetle and A. solani. ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 from CGN18024_1 convert these triose SGAs from susceptible S. commersonii to tetraose SGAs, through the addition of a glucose or xylose moiety, respectively. Both sugar additions can provide resistance to Colorado potato beetle and A. solani."

			"context": "Biosynthesis of SGAs in Solanum is controlled by many genes. The discovery of S. commersonii genotypes with and without tetraose SGAs provides us with unique insight in the role of these compounds in plant immunity. Similar compounds are produced in Solanum species such as S. chacoense, S. chomatophilum, S. oplocense, S. paucisectum, and S. piurae, which may explain why these (or their descendants) display resistance to A. solani or CPB. The compounds that are found in resistant S. commersonii are an interesting combination of a solanidine or demissidine aglycone and a lycotetraose or commertetraose sugar moiety. Solanidine forms the aglycone backbone of alpha-solanine and alpha-chaconine from potato, while the lycotetraose decoration is found on alpha-tomatine from tomato. The biosynthesis pathways leading to the production of these major SGAs from cultivated potato and tomato have largely been elucidated in recent years and it was found that the underlying genes occur in conserved clusters. This knowledge and the similarities between SGAs from S. commersonii and cultivated potato/tomato will help to identify the missing genes from the pathway through comparative genomics."

(d) Putative structures of SGAs detected in CGN18024_1 and CGN18024_3, based on previous studies. CGN18024_3 produces triose SGAs and is susceptible to Colorado potato beetle and A. solani. ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 from CGN18024_1 convert these triose SGAs from susceptible S. commersonii to tetraose SGAs, through the addition of a glucose or xylose moiety, respectively. Both sugar additions can provide resistance to Colorado potato beetle and A. solani.\nTo investigate a possible role for ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in the production of tetraose SGAs from CGN18024_1 and their link to resistance, we generated stable transformants of ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 in triose SGA producing CGN18024_3 (Figure 4:figure supplement 1). UPLC-MS analysis showed that both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants accumulate tetraose SGAs, while the amount of triose SGAs is markedly reduced (Figure 4a). Strikingly, ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 appear to have different specificities. Overexpression of ScGTR1 resulted in the addition of a hexose to the triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 (corresponding to a commertetraose), while overexpression of ScGTR2 caused the addition of a pentose (corresponding to a lycotetraose) (Figure 4a, d). This in planta evidence suggests that ScGTR1 is a glucosyltransferase and that ScGTR2 is a xylosyltransferase. However, we detect a slight overlap in activity. In addition to the lycotetraose products, we detected small amounts of commertetraose product in ScGTR1 transformants and vice versa in the ScGTR2 transformants (Figure 4a and Supplementary file 3). A multivariate principal components analysis (PCA) on the full metabolic profile consisting of all 1041 detected mass peaks revealed that ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 are highly specific towards SGAs since 75% of the metabolic variation between the transformants and the wild types could be explained by the SGA modifications (Figure 4:figure supplement 2). Modifications catalysed by both enzymes can lead to resistance, as ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants are both resistant to A. solani isolate altNL03003 (Figure 4b). Atlantic ScGTR1 and ScGTR2 transformants did not show differences in SGA profile, probably because they contain different triose SGA substrates than found in S. commersonii CGN18024_3 (Supplementary files 3 and 4)."

Wildtype CGN18024_3 is susceptible to the CPB genotype that was tested, but CGN18024_1 and CGN18024_3 transformed with ScGTR1 or ScGTR2 are resistant, as illustrated by a very low larvae weight and survival (Figure 4c). Thus, the conversion of triose SGAs from CGN18024_3 to tetraose SGAs produced by CGN18024_1, carried out by both ScGTR1 and ScGTR2, can provide protection against A. solani as well as CPB (Figure 4a-d)."

The antifungal and anti-insect activity of SGAs from S. commersonii is not restricted to potato pathogens and pests, but could also affect beneficial or commensal micro-organisms or other animals that feed on plants. In tomato fruit, alpha-tomatine is converted to esculeoside A during fruit ripening in a natural detoxification process from the plant to facilitate dispersal of the seeds by foraging animals. Unintended toxic effects of SGAs should also be taken into account when used in resistance breeding."

We had already created S. commersonii x S. tuberosum hybrids with resistance to early blight in a previous study, but it is clear that potential negative effects of SGA variants on human health and the environment should be considered before these can be developed into a cultivar."
