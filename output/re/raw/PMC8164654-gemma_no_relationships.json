The shoot length and root length was not affected in Sbeta plants under UV-B stress (Sbetauvs); however, a sharp decline in the shoot (57.15% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, 64% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs) and root (40% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, 42% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs) length was recorded in Nbetauvs plants. As a result, we found a substantial decrease of plant biomass in Nbetauvs plants, i.e., nearly 52% lower as compared with Sbetauvs plants under prolonged UV-B irradiation stress. The photosynthetic-associated characteristics were also measured which show a 27.78% increase of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in Sbetauvs plants (vs. non-stress plants). Other related parameters also show an increasing trend such as Gs, Fv/Fm, and NPQ in Sbeta plants after stress is applied. In contrast, 52.20% and 26.67% reduction in Pn (Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs and Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, respectively) was observed in Nbetauvs plants. Consistently, photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll and carotenoids were higher in Sbeta plants; however, pigment contents were significantly reduced in Nbeta plants after stress. All these findings show a positive correlation of beta-sitosterol application with growth- and development-related characteristics in rice plants during prolonged UV-B stress. Another important part of this research shows that Sbeta plants exhibit more plasticity to UV-B irradiation due to stabilization of the antioxidant system in Sbeta plants. Activities of antioxidant enzymes including SOD, POD, CAT, and APX were enhanced only in Sbeta plants while decreased significantly in Nbeta plants upon UV-B exposure. Further, a significant accumulation of several core metabolites that include organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others in Sbeta plants reveals betaSito-regulated activation of non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanism in rice plants under stress. Overall, this study is beneficial especially in terms of its involvement in plant growth and development; moreover, betaSito-regulated plasticity of plants during UV-B irradiation shows that its application could further be explored specifically in relation to different environmental stresses in other economically useful crop plants."

In higher plants, a wide variety of secondary metabolites (alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, etc.) are synthesized from primary metabolites (such as sugars, lipids, and amino acids). In plants, differential accumulation of a variety of metabolites is not directly related to their central energy metabolism or structural integrity. In fact, plant metabolites and their distribution and diversity are reflective of their essential functions in plant stress response. Furthermore, the increase of different metabolites in stressed plants is a non-enzymatic mechanism to enhance antioxidant capability in plants. Generally, these diverse solutes exhibit a high level of solubility in the cellular milieu, and their accumulation does not affect enzyme activities even at high concentrations. Moreover, the chemical nature of these osmoprotectants is very diverse that includes amino acids (proline, leucine, iso-leucine, tryptophan), amines, and gamma-amino-N-butyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, fructose) and polyols (inositol, myo-inositol), as well as different organic acids (oxalic acid, salicylic acid, ferulaic acid, etc.), accumulate in response to osmotic stress in plants."

      "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Previous studies reported that different rice cultivars are sensitive to UV-B radiation although belonging to the same ecotype. In this study, we reported the positive impact of exogenous application of beta-sitosterol (betaSito) on rice plants subjected to prolonged UV-B irradiation. Our results demonstrate that betaSito could significantly improve various aspects of growth and development when plants were subjected to UV-B stress and thus play a vital role in UV tolerance mechanisms in rice plants. The rice plants treated with betaSito (Sbeta plants) maintained their normal functions specifically photosynthesis-related processes that are generally sensitive to any stress conditions. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly higher in Sbetauvs plants than in Nbetauvs plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 2). Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants. It is important to mention that the sterol biosynthetic pathway in plants is complex that begins with squalene and is followed by its conversion to various end products. The positive role of different forms of sterols in various abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought stress has also been reported earlier."

      "context": "Over the last two decades, many studies have been conducted to understand the morpho-physiological and biochemical effects of UV-B light in plants and to reveal the mechanisms of resistance especially in UV-sensitive economically important higher plants. Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Previous studies reported that different rice cultivars are sensitive to UV-B radiation although belonging to the same ecotype. In this study, we reported the positive impact of exogenous application of beta-sitosterol (betaSito) on rice plants subjected to prolonged UV-B irradiation. Our results demonstrate that betaSito could significantly improve various aspects of growth and development when plants were subjected to UV-B stress and thus play a vital role in UV tolerance mechanisms in rice plants. The rice plants treated with betaSito (Sbeta plants) maintained their normal functions specifically photosynthesis-related processes that are generally sensitive to any stress conditions. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly higher in Sbetauvs plants than in Nbetauvs plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 2). Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants. It is important to mention that the sterol biosynthetic pathway in plants is complex that begins with squalene and is followed by its conversion to various end products. The positive role of different forms of sterols in various abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought stress has also been reported earlier."

      "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."
