			"context": "The evolutionary origin of betalain pigments in Caryophyllales and the processes that led to their homoplastic distribution have been the subject of much debate. Our new data and analyses offer compelling evidence for recurrent specialisation to betalain biosynthesis. Specifically: a background of marginal levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity implying inherent evolvability; polyphyletic origins of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity coincident with multiple inferred origins of betalain pigmentation; derived and convergent shifts in key residues underpinning high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity; and a lack of conservation of the betalain metabolic gene cluster between putative origins of betalain pigmentation. However, our hypothesis requires future experimentation. First, it will be important to identify the primary function of those DODAalpha proteins that only exhibit marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Elucidation of this unknown function will further inform the inferences made in this study and direct future hypotheses. Further validation could also emerge by considering other aspects of the betalain biosynthesis pathway. For example, as exemplified by our syntenic analyses, it may be possible to discern the signal of multiple origins at different hierarchical levels of the betalain pathway, including: patterns of gene clustering by genomic colocalisation; patterns of co-option of transcriptional regulators and other genes; and the dissection of the molecular convergence signal at key residues. It is fortunate here that three of the putative origins of betalain biosynthesis are represented by well-resourced experimental systems: Portulaca grandiflora, Mirabilis jalapa and B. vulgaris, which together promise rapid progress in this era of betalain renaissance.\n\n---\n\nThe patterns we detect may suggest lability in early stages of betalain evolution. Anthocyanins and betalains have never been found to co-occur, but it is possible that the two classes of pigments did co-occur in early evolutionary stages. In this scenario, repeated evolution of increased l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity allowed for betalain pigmentation, initially co-occurring with anthocyanins. However, evolution of an integrated betalain pathway requires more than biosynthetic enzymes (e.g. the recruitment of the MYB transcriptional regulators; Hatlestad et al., 2014). Therefore, establishment and enhancement of the betalain pathway was only achieved in certain lineages, those which specialised to betalain pigmentation. By contrast, other lineages arising close to the origins of elevated l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity specialised to anthocyanins rather than betalains, ultimately losing the DODAalpha paralogues with elevated l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. In these cases, anthocyanic lineages may have retained anthocyanins from ancestors in which both pigments coexisted, and inferences of reversals to anthocyanins based on DODA alpha loss are misleading. This scenario is appealing because we do not see any anthocyanin lineages that are nested deeply within the betalain-pigmented clades that stem from each inferred origin (Fig. 2), and so shifts to anthocyanin pigmentation seem less likely with evolutionary distance from inferred origins of betalain pigmentation.\n\n---\n\nIn contrast to the anthocyanin pathway, the betalain biosynthetic pathway is relatively simple, involving as few as four enzymatic steps to proceed from tyrosine to stable betalain pigments: yellow betaxanthins and violet betacyanins (Fig. 1). The core genes encoding betalain synthesis enzymes have been elucidated, primarily through heterologous assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana, which has emerged as an essential tool for betalain research in planta (Polturak et al., 2016; Timoneda et al., 2018). The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments. l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family (Christinet et al., 2004). Within Caryophyllales, a gene duplication in the LigB/DODA gene lineage gave rise to the DODAalpha and DODAbeta clades, with l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity previously inferred to have evolved at the base of the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). On the basis of this Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, and subsequent losses of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages, we previously argued for a single origin of betalain pigmentation, with multiple reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015)."

Both patterns link to the concept of evolutionary precursors in which underlying evolutionary state(s) potentiate recurrent evolution of subsequent complex traits (sensu Marazzi et al., 2012). In this scenario, we propose that an initial precursor step was the evolution of tyrosine hydroxylase activity by duplication in the CYP76AD lineage, leading to an abundance of l-DOPA (DeLoache et al., 2015; Polturak et al., 2016; Sunnadeniya et al., 2016), the necessary substrate for betalamic acid biosynthesis. Given an abundance of l-DOPA, a subsequent precursor step was duplication in the DODA lineage that gave rise to a clade of DODAalpha enzymes, whose ancestral function is currently unknown, but presumably with some promiscuous ability to act on l-DOPA to produce trace betalamic acid. Subsequently, further repeated duplication within the DODAalpha lineage led to recurrent neofunctionalisation towards high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the production of betalamic acid."

Mapping the functional data to the tree reveals that DODAalpha homologues exhibiting l-DOPA 4,5-dioxgenase activity have a homoplastic distribution across the DODA phylogeny (Fig. 6). In total, there are three polyphyletic gene lineages containing high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity (DODAalpha1): a lineage specific to Stegnosperma singly represented by ShDODAalpha1, a clade arising by duplication within Amaranthaceae containing BvDODAalpha1 and CqDODA-1, and a clade representing the remaining betalain-pigmented lineages, and containing CgDODA1, MjDODA alpha 1, McDODA alpha 1, PmDOD and PgDODA (Table S6). Each clade containing high-activity DODAalpha paralogues is sister to clades containing marginal activity DODAalpha paralogues, and in the case of Amaranthaceae, the DODAalpha1 clade is nested within clades exhibiting no or only marginal levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxgenase activity (Fig. 6).\n\n---\n\nTo address this, we functionally characterised 23 distinct DODA proteins for l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, from four betalain-pigmented and five anthocyanin-pigmented species, representing key evolutionary transitions across Caryophyllales.

			"context": "We selected four betalain-pigmented species that represent each of the inferred origins of betalain pigmentation, three of which are represented by complete annotated genomes: S. halimifolium (Stegnospermataceae), B. vulgaris (Amaranthaceae; Dohm et al., 2014), M. crystallinum (Aizoaceae; W. C. Yim, unpublished) and C. gigantea (Cactaceae; Copetti et al., 2017). S. halimifolium, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea each contain one DODAbeta and two DODA alpha genes, and B. vulgaris contains one DODAbeta and five DODA alpha genes (Figs S5, S6). The DODA genes for all four species were separately cloned into multigene vectors containing all necessary genes for betalain biosynthesis and these vectors were transiently transformed into N. benthamiana to test their heterologous expression (Fig. S1; Timoneda et al., 2018). We used the production of betacyanin in this heterologous assay as a proxy for l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, with the relative strength of betacyanin production indicating the relative strength of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity between loci. Upon heterologous expression, none of the DODAbeta genes from S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea produced visible betacyanin pigmentation (Fig. 3a; Timoneda et al., 2018). Traces of betanin were detected for all loci by HPLC, but amounts were extremely low compared to the positive control, BvDODAalpha1 (< 0.1%; Fig. 3b).\n\n---\n\nIn contrast to the anthocyanin pathway, the betalain biosynthetic pathway is relatively simple, involving as few as four enzymatic steps to proceed from tyrosine to stable betalain pigments: yellow betaxanthins and violet betacyanins (Fig. 1). The core genes encoding betalain synthesis enzymes have been elucidated, primarily through heterologous assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana, which has emerged as an essential tool for betalain research in planta (Polturak et al., 2016; Timoneda et al., 2018). The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments. l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family (Christinet et al., 2004). Within Caryophyllales, a gene duplication in the LigB/DODA gene lineage gave rise to the DODAalpha and DODAbeta clades, with l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity previously inferred to have evolved at the base of the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). On the basis of this Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, and subsequent losses of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages, we previously argued for a single origin of betalain pigmentation, with multiple reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015).\n\n---\n\nHowever, evolutionary patterns within the DODAalpha lineage are complex (Brockington et al., 2015). In addition to the DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, there have been at least nine duplications in the DODAalpha lineage resulting in all betalain-pigmented lineages of Caryophyllales containing at least three DODA genes - at least one homologue from the DODAbeta lineage and at least two paralogues from the DODAalpha lineage, with Beta vulgaris containing five copies of DODA alpha. In B. vulgaris, only two DODAalpha paralogues have been studied (Sasaki et al., 2009; Gandia-Herrero & Garcia-Carmona, 2012; Hatlestad et al., 2012; Chung et al., 2015; Bean et al., 2018), with one paralogue, BvDODA1 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha1), found to exhibit high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the other paralogue, BvDODA2 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha2), exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Bean et al. (2018) compared BvDODAalpha1 and BvDODAalpha2 and identified seven divergent residues that, when altered in BvDODAalpha2, were sufficient to allow BvDODAalpha2 to convert l-DOPA to betalamic acid in yeast. Like BvDODAalpha2, two DODAalpha paralogues from other species (Parakeelya mirabilis and a Ptilotus hybrid) have also been shown to have limited or no capacity to produce betalamic acid (Chung et al., 2015). Extensive gene duplication within the DODAalpha lineage and the conserved presence of paralogues exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity suggests further sub- and/or neofunctionalisation events occurring within the DODAalpha clade, although the evolutionary significance of this is unclear."

			"justification": "high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity evolved exclusively within the DODAalpha lineage",
			"context": "To explore the hypothesis of multiple origins of betalain pigmentation suggested by our reconstructions, we then selected four species that represent each of the putative origins: S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea. Using heterologous transient assays, we inferred relative levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity based on the proxy of betanin production (Fig. 3). Our data show that activity is barely detectable in DODAbeta loci from betalain-pigmented species, supporting our original hypothesis that the high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity evolved exclusively within the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). However, although betalain-pigmented species have multiple paralogues of DODAalpha genes, only one of these DODAalpha in each species encodes a protein which exhibits high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. All betalain-pigmented species also exhibit DODAalpha paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and we also detected marginal activity in several anthocyanic taxa (Fig. 4). Thus, marginal activity is widespread among Caryophyllales DODAalpha enzymes, suggesting broader underlying catalytic promiscuity in the DODAalpha lineage. Catalytic promiscuity is well documented in the broader protocatechuate dioxygenase gene family of which the LigB/DODA lineage is a member (Burroughs et al., 2019). Such promiscuity is an important feature of metabolic evolution, potentially conferring evolvability (Weng & Noel, 2012; Leong & Last, 2017), and may have significant implications for the recurrent evolution of betalain pigmentation, as discussed below.\n\n---\n\nPreviously, Lopez-Nieves et al. (2018) speculated that the evolution of tyrosine-derived betalains occurred in a metabolic environment enriched for tyrosine. The arogenate dehydrogenase enzyme (ADHalpha) responsible for increased tyrosine availability is also lost and/or down-regulated in the anthocyanic Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae lineages (Lopez-Nieves et al., 2018). Therefore, the shift to anthocyanins in these taxa may indicate deeper shifts away from a tyrosine-rich metabolism towards a metabolism in which phenylalanine plays a canonical role. The primary function of the DODAalpha paralogues with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity is unknown, but may catalyse production of tyrosine-derived metabolites, other than betalains. In this scenario, the duplication that gave rise to the DODAbeta and DODAalpha lineages led to neofunctionalisation in the DODAalpha lineage towards an unknown but tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Loss of DODA alpha in Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae could instead reflect loss of the unknown tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, in the context of shifts towards more phenylalanine-biased metabolism, independent of origins of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity.\n\n---\n\nHowever, evolutionary patterns within the DODAalpha lineage are complex (Brockington et al., 2015). In addition to the DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, there have been at least nine duplications in the DODAalpha lineage resulting in all betalain-pigmented lineages of Caryophyllales containing at least three DODA genes - at least one homologue from the DODAbeta lineage and at least two paralogues from the DODAalpha lineage, with Beta vulgaris containing five copies of DODA alpha. In B. vulgaris, only two DODAalpha paralogues have been studied (Sasaki et al., 2009; Gandia-Herrero & Garcia-Carmona, 2012; Hatlestad et al., 2012; Chung et al., 2015; Bean et al., 2018), with one paralogue, BvDODA1 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha1), found to exhibit high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the other paralogue, BvDODA2 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha2), exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity.

(2018) compared BvDODAalpha1 and BvDODAalpha2 and identified seven divergent residues that, when altered in BvDODAalpha2, were sufficient to allow BvDODAalpha2 to convert l-DOPA to betalamic acid in yeast. Like BvDODAalpha2, two DODAalpha paralogues from other species (Parakeelya mirabilis and a Ptilotus hybrid) have also been shown to have limited or no capacity to produce betalamic acid (Chung et al., 2015). Extensive gene duplication within the DODAalpha lineage and the conserved presence of paralogues exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity suggests further sub- and/or neofunctionalisation events occurring within the DODAalpha clade, although the evolutionary significance of this is unclear."

			"justification": "l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family",
			"context": "In contrast to the anthocyanin pathway, the betalain biosynthetic pathway is relatively simple, involving as few as four enzymatic steps to proceed from tyrosine to stable betalain pigments: yellow betaxanthins and violet betacyanins (Fig. 1). The core genes encoding betalain synthesis enzymes have been elucidated, primarily through heterologous assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana, which has emerged as an essential tool for betalain research in planta (Polturak et al., 2016; Timoneda et al., 2018). The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments. l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family (Christinet et al., 2004). Within Caryophyllales, a gene duplication in the LigB/DODA gene lineage gave rise to the DODAalpha and DODAbeta clades, with l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity previously inferred to have evolved at the base of the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). On the basis of this Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, and subsequent losses of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages, we previously argued for a single origin of betalain pigmentation, with multiple reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015).\n\n---\n\nTo explore the hypothesis of multiple origins of betalain pigmentation suggested by our reconstructions, we then selected four species that represent each of the putative origins: S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea. Using heterologous transient assays, we inferred relative levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity based on the proxy of betanin production (Fig. 3). Our data show that activity is barely detectable in DODAbeta loci from betalain-pigmented species, supporting our original hypothesis that the high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity evolved exclusively within the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). However, although betalain-pigmented species have multiple paralogues of DODAalpha genes, only one of these DODAalpha in each species encodes a protein which exhibits high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. All betalain-pigmented species also exhibit DODAalpha paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and we also detected marginal activity in several anthocyanic taxa (Fig. 4). Thus, marginal activity is widespread among Caryophyllales DODAalpha enzymes, suggesting broader underlying catalytic promiscuity in the DODAalpha lineage. Catalytic promiscuity is well documented in the broader protocatechuate dioxygenase gene family of which the LigB/DODA lineage is a member (Burroughs et al., 2019). Such promiscuity is an important feature of metabolic evolution, potentially conferring evolvability (Weng & Noel, 2012; Leong & Last, 2017), and may have significant implications for the recurrent evolution of betalain pigmentation, as discussed below."

(a) A representative leaf is shown from the agroinfiltration of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes from Stegnosperma halimifolium, Beta vulgaris, Carnegiea gigantea and Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs containing the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The infiltration spots are labelled according to the DODA variant. For all species, the pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector is included as a positive control (P). (b) The betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC and data were represented relative to the BvDODAalpha1 spot present in each biological replicate. The data were combined after calculating relative amounts (RQ) for each species from individual species-specific experiments (Supporting Information Figs S8-S11). Bars show means +- SD; n = 5 for S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, C. gigantea and M. crystallinum, except for BvDODAalpha2 (n = 4) and BvDODAalpha3 (n = 4). (c) A representative HPLC trace for the DODA\nalpha\n1 gene from each species. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples."

(a) A representative leaf is shown from the agroinfiltration of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes from Macarthuria australis (MaDODA\nalpha), Telephium imperati (TiDODA\nalpha), Polycarpon tetraphyllum (PtDODA\nalpha), Cardionema ramosissimum (CrDODA\nalpha), Spergularia marina (SmDODA\nalpha), Limeum aethiopicum (LaDODA\nalpha) and Kewa caespitosa (KcDODA\nalpha\n1, KcDODA\nalpha\n2). The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs with the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector was included as a positive control (P). (b) Betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC. Amounts of betanin were calculated relative (RQ) to the average amount of betanin present in BvDODAalpha1 infiltration spots for each species and the data combined into one graph (see Supporting Information Fig. S12 for species-specific data). Bars show means +- SD; n >= 3. (c) A representative HPLC trace for each DODA\nalpha gene from each species is shown. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl, which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples.\n\n---\n\nHowever, evolutionary patterns within the DODAalpha lineage are complex (Brockington et al., 2015). In addition to the DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, there have been at least nine duplications in the DODAalpha lineage resulting in all betalain-pigmented lineages of Caryophyllales containing at least three DODA genes - at least one homologue from the DODAbeta lineage and at least two paralogues from the DODAalpha lineage, with Beta vulgaris containing five copies of DODA alpha. In B. vulgaris, only two DODAalpha paralogues have been studied (Sasaki et al., 2009; Gandia-Herrero & Garcia-Carmona, 2012; Hatlestad et al., 2012; Chung et al., 2015; Bean et al., 2018), with one paralogue, BvDODA1 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha1), found to exhibit high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the other paralogue, BvDODA2 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha2), exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Bean et al. (2018) compared BvDODAalpha1 and BvDODAalpha2 and identified seven divergent residues that, when altered in BvDODAalpha2, were sufficient to allow BvDODAalpha2 to convert l-DOPA to betalamic acid in yeast. Like BvDODAalpha2, two DODAalpha paralogues from other species (Parakeelya mirabilis and a Ptilotus hybrid) have also been shown to have limited or no capacity to produce betalamic acid (Chung et al., 2015). Extensive gene duplication within the DODAalpha lineage and the conserved presence of paralogues exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity suggests further sub- and/or neofunctionalisation events occurring within the DODAalpha clade, although the evolutionary significance of this is unclear.\n\n---\n\nUsing the same procedure as that used to test the DODAbeta enzymes, we found that only a single DODAalpha from each study species showed a strong production of betalain pigmentation including BvDODAalpha1 (Figs 3, S8-S11). All paralogues exhibiting high production of betanin in the heterologous assay (which we term as having high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity) are hereafter named \"alpha1\". The amount of betanin produced by the different orthologues of DODAalpha1 varies relative to BvDODAalpha1, indicating that there may be differences in the effectiveness of these DODAalpha enzymes to convert l-DOPA to betalamic acid (Fig. 3b). For example, ShDODAalpha1 produced a comparable amount of pigment to BvDODAalpha1, CgDODAalpha1 produced c. 60% as much as BvDODAalpha1, and McDODAalpha1 produced c. 80% more than BvDODAalpha1."

			"context": "We selected four betalain-pigmented species that represent each of the inferred origins of betalain pigmentation, three of which are represented by complete annotated genomes: S. halimifolium (Stegnospermataceae), B. vulgaris (Amaranthaceae; Dohm et al., 2014), M. crystallinum (Aizoaceae; W. C. Yim, unpublished) and C. gigantea (Cactaceae; Copetti et al., 2017). S. halimifolium, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea each contain one DODAbeta and two DODA alpha genes, and B. vulgaris contains one DODAbeta and five DODA alpha genes (Figs S5, S6). The DODA genes for all four species were separately cloned into multigene vectors containing all necessary genes for betalain biosynthesis and these vectors were transiently transformed into N. benthamiana to test their heterologous expression (Fig. S1; Timoneda et al., 2018). We used the production of betacyanin in this heterologous assay as a proxy for l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, with the relative strength of betacyanin production indicating the relative strength of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity between loci. Upon heterologous expression, none of the DODAbeta genes from S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea produced visible betacyanin pigmentation (Fig. 3a; Timoneda et al., 2018). Traces of betanin were detected for all loci by HPLC, but amounts were extremely low compared to the positive control, BvDODAalpha1 (< 0.1%; Fig. 3b).\n\n---\n\nIt has always been striking that each major betalain-pigmentated clade is subtended at, or towards, its base by an anthocyanic lineage (Brockington et al., 2011). Given this essential pattern, our trait reconstructions suggest multiple origins of betalain pigmentation. In turn, this implies that many lineages are anthocyanic through retention of an ancestral state, rather than through reversal from betalain pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2011; Fig. 2). Yet, we earlier reported that DODA alpha are lost or down-regulated in anthocyanic Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae, and previously argued that loss of DODA alpha in these anthocyanic lineages is consistent with reversals from betalain pigmentation to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015). However, the emerging picture is more complex, and with new data presented here, we find: evidence of DODA alpha loci in all but one of the anthocyanic lineages in Caryophyllales; evidence of DODA alpha gene loss in Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae, but no evidence of DODA alpha gene loss in the anthocyanin-pigmented lineages, K. caespitosa, M. australis and L. aethiopicum; and evidence of DODA alpha loci with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity within anthocyanic M. australis, K. caespitosa, C. ramosissimum and T. imperati. Clearly, evolutionarily disparate anthocyanic lineages show different patterns of molecular evolution with respect to DODA alpha. Given this complex evolutionary milieu, and in the face of compelling evidence for polyphyletic origins of elevated l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, below we propose two alternative hypotheses to explain loss of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages.\n\n---\n\nA recent study characterised seven residues that are important for l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity (Bean et al., 2018). We carried out ancestral sequence reconstruction using coding sequences on a reduced DODA alpha gene tree (Figs S13, S14) and observed that the three putative origins of highly active DODAalpha are marked by three convergent shifts in these seven residues (Figs 6, 7), which occur post-gene duplication. For the residues inferred for the clade containing the M. crystallinum and C. gigantea highly active DODAalpha (DDFNDDI; Fig. 7), four out of seven of the predicted residues are identical to those inferred for the Amaranthaceae highly active DODAalpha clade (DDYNDET). For Stegnosperma, the motif is more divergent, with three residues identical to the Amaranthaceae betalain-producing DODAalpha clade and two residues identical to the clade containing the M. crystallinum and C. gigantea highly active DODAalpha. The highly active DODAalpha are derived from ancestral nodes with inferred motifs that share more similarity with the marginal or no activity DODAalpha lineages (XGFNN[N/D]T), and this motif is highly conserved across the backbone and represented at almost all ancestral nodes (Figs 6, 7). Amino acid reconstruction gave similar results (Figs S15, S16)."

Specifically, each clade containing high-activity DODAalpha paralogues is sister to clades containing marginal activity DODAalpha, suggesting polyphyletic origins of high activity, associated with gene duplication within the DODAalpha lineage. Previous research identified residues in seven sites which were necessary and sufficient to confer higher levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity (Bean et al., 2018). Phylogenetic reconstruction of these seven residues across the DODAalpha clade showed that polyphyletic clades containing proteins with high activity have distinctive motifs for these seven residues (Figs 6, 7). Furthermore, motifs associated with high activity evolved at least three times from a background of motifs more similar to those proteins with no or marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. The diversity we recognise at these motifs in high-activity DODAalpha sequences (e.g. between BvDODAalpha1 and ShDODAalpha1) indicates that high activity may arise from divergent sequence motifs and represent molecular convergence at key functional residues."

			"context": "To understand the evolution of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxgenase activity, we mapped our functional data to the DODA gene tree (Fig. 6), and also mapped functional data from studies for which DODA activity has been tested in planta, either in heterologous transient assays or stable transgenics, or using recombinant expression in Escherichia coli or yeast (Figs 3, 4; Table S6). Mapping the functional data to the tree reveals that DODAalpha homologues exhibiting l-DOPA 4,5-dioxgenase activity have a homoplastic distribution across the DODA phylogeny (Fig. 6). In total, there are three polyphyletic gene lineages containing high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity (DODAalpha1): a lineage specific to Stegnosperma singly represented by ShDODAalpha1, a clade arising by duplication within Amaranthaceae containing BvDODAalpha1 and CqDODA-1, and a clade representing the remaining betalain-pigmented lineages, and containing CgDODA1, MjDODA alpha 1, McDODA alpha 1, PmDOD and PgDODA (Table S6). Each clade containing high-activity DODAalpha paralogues is sister to clades containing marginal activity DODAalpha paralogues, and in the case of Amaranthaceae, the DODAalpha1 clade is nested within clades exhibiting no or only marginal levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxgenase activity (Fig. 6).\n\n---\n\nPrevious analysis of the genome of B. vulgaris revealed a putative 'gene cluster' (sensu Osbourn, 2010) in which DODAalpha and CYP76AD1 are colocalised in chromosome 2 (Brockington et al., 2015). The B. vulgaris locus with high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity falls within this operon, while the paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity occur outside of the gene cluster, supporting the concept of a betalain gene cluster in B. vulgaris. Our analysis, which describes the relative synteny of homologous loci between genomes, also shows that the betalain gene cluster appears to be conserved in the genomes of C. quinoa and A. hypochondriacus (Fig. 5). These divergent species all belong to the family Amaranthaceae and represent one putative origin of betalain pigmentation (Fig. 2, origin no. 2). However, CYP76AD1 and DODAalpha1 are not clustered in the genome of M. crystallinum, which represents a different putative origin (Fig. 2, origin no. 3). Therefore, the absence of colocalisation in M. crystallinum highlights interesting structural genomic differences among putative betalain origins."

The B. vulgaris locus with high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity falls within this operon, while the paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity occur outside of the gene cluster, supporting the concept of a betalain gene cluster in B. vulgaris. Our analysis, which describes the relative synteny of homologous loci between genomes, also shows that the betalain gene cluster appears to be conserved in the genomes of C. quinoa and A. hypochondriacus (Fig. 5). These divergent species all belong to the family Amaranthaceae and represent one putative origin of betalain pigmentation (Fig. 2, origin no. 2). However, CYP76AD1 and DODAalpha1 are not clustered in the genome of M. crystallinum, which represents a different putative origin (Fig. 2, origin no. 3). Therefore, the absence of colocalisation in M. crystallinum highlights interesting structural genomic differences among putative betalain origins."

Both patterns link to the concept of evolutionary precursors in which underlying evolutionary state(s) potentiate recurrent evolution of subsequent complex traits (sensu Marazzi et al., 2012). In this scenario, we propose that an initial precursor step was the evolution of tyrosine hydroxylase activity by duplication in the CYP76AD lineage, leading to an abundance of l-DOPA (DeLoache et al., 2015; Polturak et al., 2016; Sunnadeniya et al., 2016), the necessary substrate for betalamic acid biosynthesis. Given an abundance of l-DOPA, a subsequent precursor step was duplication in the DODA lineage that gave rise to a clade of DODAalpha enzymes, whose ancestral function is currently unknown, but presumably with some promiscuous ability to act on l-DOPA to produce trace betalamic acid. Subsequently, further repeated duplication within the DODAalpha lineage led to recurrent neofunctionalisation towards high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the production of betalamic acid."

			"context": "In the current study, we explore the evolution of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity in Caryophyllales, focusing on paralogy within the DODA lineage. In the context of an updated organismal phylogeny and new pigment data, we select species representing key inferred transitions in pigment gain and loss. We then assess their DODA paralogues for levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity using an established heterologous assay in N. benthamiana. We use the production of betacyanin in this heterologous assay as a proxy for l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, with the relative strength of betacyanin production indicating the relative strength of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity between paralogues. By mapping activity to a comprehensive DODA phylogeny, we reveal that multiple acquisitions of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity are linked with repeated gene duplication events within the DODAalpha lineage. Furthermore, we find that marginal levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity are distributed across the DODAalpha lineage, implying that marginal levels of activity were present prior to multiple origins of high activity. Recurrent origins of high activity are accompanied by convergent shifts in residues known to be sufficient to confer l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. We reconcile these data with inferred patterns of pigment evolution and argue that recurrent acquisition of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity underlies polyphyletic patterns of betalain pigmentation in Caryophyllales.\n\n---\n\nTo understand the evolution of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxgenase activity, we mapped our functional data to the DODA gene tree (Fig. 6), and also mapped functional data from studies for which DODA activity has been tested in planta, either in heterologous transient assays or stable transgenics, or using recombinant expression in Escherichia coli or yeast (Figs 3, 4; Table S6). Mapping the functional data to the tree reveals that DODAalpha homologues exhibiting l-DOPA 4,5-dioxgenase activity have a homoplastic distribution across the DODA phylogeny (Fig. 6). In total, there are three polyphyletic gene lineages containing high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity (DODAalpha1): a lineage specific to Stegnosperma singly represented by ShDODAalpha1, a clade arising by duplication within Amaranthaceae containing BvDODAalpha1 and CqDODA-1, and a clade representing the remaining betalain-pigmented lineages, and containing CgDODA1, MjDODA alpha 1, McDODA alpha 1, PmDOD and PgDODA (Table S6). Each clade containing high-activity DODAalpha paralogues is sister to clades containing marginal activity DODAalpha paralogues, and in the case of Amaranthaceae, the DODAalpha1 clade is nested within clades exhibiting no or only marginal levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxgenase activity (Fig. 6).\n\n---\n\nTo explore the hypothesis of multiple origins of betalain pigmentation suggested by our reconstructions, we then selected four species that represent each of the putative origins: S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea. Using heterologous transient assays, we inferred relative levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity based on the proxy of betanin production (Fig. 3). Our data show that activity is barely detectable in DODAbeta loci from betalain-pigmented species, supporting our original hypothesis that the high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity evolved exclusively within the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). However, although betalain-pigmented species have multiple paralogues of DODAalpha genes, only one of these DODAalpha in each species encodes a protein which exhibits high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. All betalain-pigmented species also exhibit DODAalpha paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and we also detected marginal activity in several anthocyanic taxa (Fig. 4). Thus, marginal activity is widespread among Caryophyllales DODAalpha enzymes, suggesting broader underlying catalytic promiscuity in the DODAalpha lineage. Catalytic promiscuity is well documented in the broader protocatechuate dioxygenase gene family of which the LigB/DODA lineage is a member (Burroughs et al., 2019). Such promiscuity is an important feature of metabolic evolution, potentially conferring evolvability (Weng & Noel, 2012; Leong & Last, 2017), and may have significant implications for the recurrent evolution of betalain pigmentation, as discussed below."

			"context": "To address this, we functionally characterised 23 distinct DODA proteins for l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, from four betalain-pigmented and five anthocyanin-pigmented species, representing key evolutionary transitions across Caryophyllales. By mapping these functional data to an updated DODA phylogeny, we then explored the evolution of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity.\n\n---\n\nIn the context of an updated organismal phylogeny and newly inferred pigment reconstructions, we argue that repeated convergent acquisition of elevated l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity is consistent with recurrent specialisation to betalain synthesis in Caryophyllales.\n\n---\n\nA recent study characterised seven residues that are important for l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity (Bean et al., 2018). We carried out ancestral sequence reconstruction using coding sequences on a reduced DODA alpha gene tree (Figs S13, S14) and observed that the three putative origins of highly active DODAalpha are marked by three convergent shifts in these seven residues (Figs 6, 7), which occur post-gene duplication. For the residues inferred for the clade containing the M. crystallinum and C. gigantea highly active DODAalpha (DDFNDDI; Fig. 7), four out of seven of the predicted residues are identical to those inferred for the Amaranthaceae highly active DODAalpha clade (DDYNDET). For Stegnosperma, the motif is more divergent, with three residues identical to the Amaranthaceae betalain-producing DODAalpha clade and two residues identical to the clade containing the M. crystallinum and C. gigantea highly active DODAalpha. The highly active DODAalpha are derived from ancestral nodes with inferred motifs that share more similarity with the marginal or no activity DODAalpha lineages (XGFNN[N/D]T), and this motif is highly conserved across the backbone and represented at almost all ancestral nodes (Figs 6, 7). Amino acid reconstruction gave similar results (Figs S15, S16)."

Both patterns link to the concept of evolutionary precursors in which underlying evolutionary state(s) potentiate recurrent evolution of subsequent complex traits (sensu Marazzi et al., 2012). In this scenario, we propose that an initial precursor step was the evolution of tyrosine hydroxylase activity by duplication in the CYP76AD lineage, leading to an abundance of l-DOPA (DeLoache et al., 2015; Polturak et al., 2016; Sunnadeniya et al., 2016), the necessary substrate for betalamic acid biosynthesis. Given an abundance of l-DOPA, a subsequent precursor step was duplication in the DODA lineage that gave rise to a clade of DODAalpha enzymes, whose ancestral function is currently unknown, but presumably with some promiscuous ability to act on l-DOPA to produce trace betalamic acid. Subsequently, further repeated duplication within the DODAalpha lineage led to recurrent neofunctionalisation towards high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the production of betalamic acid."

			"context": "We selected four betalain-pigmented species that represent each of the inferred origins of betalain pigmentation, three of which are represented by complete annotated genomes: S. halimifolium (Stegnospermataceae), B. vulgaris (Amaranthaceae; Dohm et al., 2014), M. crystallinum (Aizoaceae; W. C. Yim, unpublished) and C. gigantea (Cactaceae; Copetti et al., 2017). S. halimifolium, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea each contain one DODAbeta and two DODA alpha genes, and B. vulgaris contains one DODAbeta and five DODA alpha genes (Figs S5, S6). The DODA genes for all four species were separately cloned into multigene vectors containing all necessary genes for betalain biosynthesis and these vectors were transiently transformed into N. benthamiana to test their heterologous expression (Fig. S1; Timoneda et al., 2018). We used the production of betacyanin in this heterologous assay as a proxy for l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, with the relative strength of betacyanin production indicating the relative strength of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity between loci. Upon heterologous expression, none of the DODAbeta genes from S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea produced visible betacyanin pigmentation (Fig. 3a; Timoneda et al., 2018). Traces of betanin were detected for all loci by HPLC, but amounts were extremely low compared to the positive control, BvDODAalpha1 (< 0.1%; Fig. 3b).\n\n---\n\nPrevious analysis of the genome of B. vulgaris revealed a putative 'gene cluster' (sensu Osbourn, 2010) in which DODAalpha and CYP76AD1 are colocalised in chromosome 2 (Brockington et al., 2015). The B. vulgaris locus with high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity falls within this operon, while the paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity occur outside of the gene cluster, supporting the concept of a betalain gene cluster in B. vulgaris. Our analysis, which describes the relative synteny of homologous loci between genomes, also shows that the betalain gene cluster appears to be conserved in the genomes of C. quinoa and A. hypochondriacus (Fig. 5). These divergent species all belong to the family Amaranthaceae and represent one putative origin of betalain pigmentation (Fig. 2, origin no. 2). However, CYP76AD1 and DODAalpha1 are not clustered in the genome of M. crystallinum, which represents a different putative origin (Fig. 2, origin no. 3). Therefore, the absence of colocalisation in M. crystallinum highlights interesting structural genomic differences among putative betalain origins.\n\n---\n\nHowever, evolutionary patterns within the DODAalpha lineage are complex (Brockington et al., 2015). In addition to the DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, there have been at least nine duplications in the DODAalpha lineage resulting in all betalain-pigmented lineages of Caryophyllales containing at least three DODA genes - at least one homologue from the DODAbeta lineage and at least two paralogues from the DODAalpha lineage, with Beta vulgaris containing five copies of DODA alpha. In B. vulgaris, only two DODAalpha paralogues have been studied (Sasaki et al., 2009; Gandia-Herrero & Garcia-Carmona, 2012; Hatlestad et al., 2012; Chung et al., 2015; Bean et al., 2018), with one paralogue, BvDODA1 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha1), found to exhibit high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the other paralogue, BvDODA2 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha2), exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Bean et al. (2018) compared BvDODAalpha1 and BvDODAalpha2 and identified seven divergent residues that, when altered in BvDODAalpha2, were sufficient to allow BvDODAalpha2 to convert l-DOPA to betalamic acid in yeast. Like BvDODAalpha2, two DODAalpha paralogues from other species (Parakeelya mirabilis and a Ptilotus hybrid) have also been shown to have limited or no capacity to produce betalamic acid (Chung et al., 2015). Extensive gene duplication within the DODAalpha lineage and the conserved presence of paralogues exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity suggests further sub- and/or neofunctionalisation events occurring within the DODAalpha clade, although the evolutionary significance of this is unclear."

In turn, this implies that many lineages are anthocyanic through retention of an ancestral state, rather than through reversal from betalain pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2011; Fig. 2). Yet, we earlier reported that DODA alpha are lost or down-regulated in anthocyanic Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae, and previously argued that loss of DODA alpha in these anthocyanic lineages is consistent with reversals from betalain pigmentation to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015). However, the emerging picture is more complex, and with new data presented here, we find: evidence of DODA alpha loci in all but one of the anthocyanic lineages in Caryophyllales; evidence of DODA alpha gene loss in Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae, but no evidence of DODA alpha gene loss in the anthocyanin-pigmented lineages, K. caespitosa, M. australis and L. aethiopicum; and evidence of DODA alpha loci with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity within anthocyanic M. australis, K. caespitosa, C. ramosissimum and T. imperati. Clearly, evolutionarily disparate anthocyanic lineages show different patterns of molecular evolution with respect to DODA alpha. Given this complex evolutionary milieu, and in the face of compelling evidence for polyphyletic origins of elevated l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, below we propose two alternative hypotheses to explain loss of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages.\n\n---\n\nThe DODA gene tree shows a homoplasious distribution of functionally characterised DODA genes that produce a high level of betalain pigments. The maximum likelihood phylogeny of Caryophyllales l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes was inferred from coding sequences derived from genomes and transcriptomes. Branch lengths are expected number of substitutions per site. Scale bar gives 0.2 expected substitutions per site. Branch labels are support values for major paralogous clades from rapid bootstrapping and the SH-like Approximate Likelihood Ratio Test, respectively, given as RBS/SH-aLRT. Putative major duplication nodes are highlighted with stars. Branches are coloured according to the putative pigmentation state of the taxa (blue, anthocyanin; pink, betalain). Labelled tips show functionally characterised DODAs and shaded squares correspond to DODA activity (white, no activity; grey, marginal activity; black, high activity). Asterisks indicate putative pseudogenes. Annotated at tips is a colour-coded alignment of the seven residues conferring high activity reported in Bean et al. (2018). XxDODA: Bv, Beta vulgaris; Cg, Carnegiea gigantea; Cr, Cardionema ramosissimum; Ds, Dianthus superbus; Kc, Kewa caespitosa; La, Limeum aethiopicum; Mc, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum; Ma, Macarthuria australis; Mj, Mirabilis jalapa; Pg, Portulaca grandiflora; Phyb, Ptilotus hybrid; Pm, Parakeelya mirabilis; Pt, Polycarpon tetraphyllum; Sh, Stegnosperma halimifolium; Sm, Spergularia marina; Ti, Telephium imperati.\n\n---\n\n\nl-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity is marginal or absent in DODA from anthocyanin-producing taxa when heterologously expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana. (a) A representative leaf is shown from the agroinfiltration of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes from Macarthuria australis (MaDODA\nalpha), Telephium imperati (TiDODA\nalpha), Polycarpon tetraphyllum (PtDODA\nalpha), Cardionema ramosissimum (CrDODA\nalpha), Spergularia marina (SmDODA\nalpha), Limeum aethiopicum (LaDODA\nalpha) and Kewa caespitosa (KcDODA\nalpha\n1, KcDODA\nalpha\n2). The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs with the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector was included as a positive control (P). (b) Betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC. Amounts of betanin were calculated relative (RQ) to the average amount of betanin present in BvDODAalpha1 infiltration spots for each species and the data combined into one graph (see Supporting Information Fig. S12 for species-specific data). Bars show means +- SD; n >= 3. (c) A representative HPLC trace for each DODA\nalpha gene from each species is shown. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl, which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples."

(a) A representative leaf is shown from the agroinfiltration of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes from Macarthuria australis (MaDODA\nalpha), Telephium imperati (TiDODA\nalpha), Polycarpon tetraphyllum (PtDODA\nalpha), Cardionema ramosissimum (CrDODA\nalpha), Spergularia marina (SmDODA\nalpha), Limeum aethiopicum (LaDODA\nalpha) and Kewa caespitosa (KcDODA\nalpha\n1, KcDODA\nalpha\n2). The DODA coding sequences were cloned into multigene constructs with the other structural genes necessary for betacyanin production (BvCYP76AD1, MjcDOPA-5GT). The pBC-BvDODAalpha1 multigene vector was included as a positive control (P). (b) Betanin content of the infiltration spots was measured using HPLC. Amounts of betanin were calculated relative (RQ) to the average amount of betanin present in BvDODAalpha1 infiltration spots for each species and the data combined into one graph (see Supporting Information Fig. S12 for species-specific data). Bars show means +- SD; n >= 3. (c) A representative HPLC trace for each DODA\nalpha gene from each species is shown. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl, which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples.\n\n---\n\nIt has always been striking that each major betalain-pigmentated clade is subtended at, or towards, its base by an anthocyanic lineage (Brockington et al., 2011). Given this essential pattern, our trait reconstructions suggest multiple origins of betalain pigmentation. In turn, this implies that many lineages are anthocyanic through retention of an ancestral state, rather than through reversal from betalain pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2011; Fig. 2). Yet, we earlier reported that DODA alpha are lost or down-regulated in anthocyanic Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae, and previously argued that loss of DODA alpha in these anthocyanic lineages is consistent with reversals from betalain pigmentation to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015). However, the emerging picture is more complex, and with new data presented here, we find: evidence of DODA alpha loci in all but one of the anthocyanic lineages in Caryophyllales; evidence of DODA alpha gene loss in Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae, but no evidence of DODA alpha gene loss in the anthocyanin-pigmented lineages, K. caespitosa, M. australis and L. aethiopicum; and evidence of DODA alpha loci with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity within anthocyanic M. australis, K. caespitosa, C. ramosissimum and T. imperati. Clearly, evolutionarily disparate anthocyanic lineages show different patterns of molecular evolution with respect to DODA alpha. Given this complex evolutionary milieu, and in the face of compelling evidence for polyphyletic origins of elevated l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, below we propose two alternative hypotheses to explain loss of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages."

Our new data and analyses offer compelling evidence for recurrent specialisation to betalain biosynthesis. Specifically: a background of marginal levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity implying inherent evolvability; polyphyletic origins of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity coincident with multiple inferred origins of betalain pigmentation; derived and convergent shifts in key residues underpinning high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity; and a lack of conservation of the betalain metabolic gene cluster between putative origins of betalain pigmentation. However, our hypothesis requires future experimentation. First, it will be important to identify the primary function of those DODAalpha proteins that only exhibit marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Elucidation of this unknown function will further inform the inferences made in this study and direct future hypotheses. Further validation could also emerge by considering other aspects of the betalain biosynthesis pathway. For example, as exemplified by our syntenic analyses, it may be possible to discern the signal of multiple origins at different hierarchical levels of the betalain pathway, including: patterns of gene clustering by genomic colocalisation; patterns of co-option of transcriptional regulators and other genes; and the dissection of the molecular convergence signal at key residues. It is fortunate here that three of the putative origins of betalain biosynthesis are represented by well-resourced experimental systems: Portulaca grandiflora, Mirabilis jalapa and B. vulgaris, which together promise rapid progress in this era of betalain renaissance."

			"justification": "repeated evolution of increased l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity allowed for betalain pigmentation",
			"context": "The patterns we detect may suggest lability in early stages of betalain evolution. Anthocyanins and betalains have never been found to co-occur, but it is possible that the two classes of pigments did co-occur in early evolutionary stages. In this scenario, repeated evolution of increased l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity allowed for betalain pigmentation, initially co-occurring with anthocyanins. However, evolution of an integrated betalain pathway requires more than biosynthetic enzymes (e.g. the recruitment of the MYB transcriptional regulators; Hatlestad et al., 2014). Therefore, establishment and enhancement of the betalain pathway was only achieved in certain lineages, those which specialised to betalain pigmentation. By contrast, other lineages arising close to the origins of elevated l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity specialised to anthocyanins rather than betalains, ultimately losing the DODAalpha paralogues with elevated l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. In these cases, anthocyanic lineages may have retained anthocyanins from ancestors in which both pigments coexisted, and inferences of reversals to anthocyanins based on DODA alpha loss are misleading. This scenario is appealing because we do not see any anthocyanin lineages that are nested deeply within the betalain-pigmented clades that stem from each inferred origin (Fig. 2), and so shifts to anthocyanin pigmentation seem less likely with evolutionary distance from inferred origins of betalain pigmentation.\n\n---\n\nIt has always been striking that each major betalain-pigmentated clade is subtended at, or towards, its base by an anthocyanic lineage (Brockington et al., 2011). Given this essential pattern, our trait reconstructions suggest multiple origins of betalain pigmentation. In turn, this implies that many lineages are anthocyanic through retention of an ancestral state, rather than through reversal from betalain pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2011; Fig. 2). Yet, we earlier reported that DODA alpha are lost or down-regulated in anthocyanic Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae, and previously argued that loss of DODA alpha in these anthocyanic lineages is consistent with reversals from betalain pigmentation to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015). However, the emerging picture is more complex, and with new data presented here, we find: evidence of DODA alpha loci in all but one of the anthocyanic lineages in Caryophyllales; evidence of DODA alpha gene loss in Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae, but no evidence of DODA alpha gene loss in the anthocyanin-pigmented lineages, K. caespitosa, M. australis and L. aethiopicum; and evidence of DODA alpha loci with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity within anthocyanic M. australis, K. caespitosa, C. ramosissimum and T. imperati. Clearly, evolutionarily disparate anthocyanic lineages show different patterns of molecular evolution with respect to DODA alpha. Given this complex evolutionary milieu, and in the face of compelling evidence for polyphyletic origins of elevated l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, below we propose two alternative hypotheses to explain loss of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages.\n\n---\n\nTo explore the hypothesis of multiple origins of betalain pigmentation suggested by our reconstructions, we then selected four species that represent each of the putative origins: S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea. Using heterologous transient assays, we inferred relative levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity based on the proxy of betanin production (Fig. 3). Our data show that activity is barely detectable in DODAbeta loci from betalain-pigmented species, supporting our original hypothesis that the high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity evolved exclusively within the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). However, although betalain-pigmented species have multiple paralogues of DODAalpha genes, only one of these DODAalpha in each species encodes a protein which exhibits high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. All betalain-pigmented species also exhibit DODAalpha paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and we also detected marginal activity in several anthocyanic taxa (Fig. 4). Thus, marginal activity is widespread among Caryophyllales DODAalpha enzymes, suggesting broader underlying catalytic promiscuity in the DODAalpha lineage. Catalytic promiscuity is well documented in the broader protocatechuate dioxygenase gene family of which the LigB/DODA lineage is a member (Burroughs et al., 2019). Such promiscuity is an important feature of metabolic evolution, potentially conferring evolvability (Weng & Noel, 2012; Leong & Last, 2017), and may have significant implications for the recurrent evolution of betalain pigmentation, as discussed below."

The maximum likelihood phylogeny of Caryophyllales l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase (DODA) genes was inferred from coding sequences derived from genomes and transcriptomes. Branch lengths are expected number of substitutions per site. Scale bar gives 0.2 expected substitutions per site. Branch labels are support values for major paralogous clades from rapid bootstrapping and the SH-like Approximate Likelihood Ratio Test, respectively, given as RBS/SH-aLRT. Putative major duplication nodes are highlighted with stars. Branches are coloured according to the putative pigmentation state of the taxa (blue, anthocyanin; pink, betalain). Labelled tips show functionally characterised DODAs and shaded squares correspond to DODA activity (white, no activity; grey, marginal activity; black, high activity). Asterisks indicate putative pseudogenes. Annotated at tips is a colour-coded alignment of the seven residues conferring high activity reported in Bean et al. (2018). XxDODA: Bv, Beta vulgaris; Cg, Carnegiea gigantea; Cr, Cardionema ramosissimum; Ds, Dianthus superbus; Kc, Kewa caespitosa; La, Limeum aethiopicum; Mc, Mesembryanthemum crystallinum; Ma, Macarthuria australis; Mj, Mirabilis jalapa; Pg, Portulaca grandiflora; Phyb, Ptilotus hybrid; Pm, Parakeelya mirabilis; Pt, Polycarpon tetraphyllum; Sh, Stegnosperma halimifolium; Sm, Spergularia marina; Ti, Telephium imperati.\n\n---\n\nSummary of the major evolutionary changes inferred with respect to transitions in pigment type and corresponding transitions in l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. (a) Simplified pigment reconstruction shows family-level relationships with numbers in purple circles representing the four inferred origins of betalain pigmentation. Tips are coloured according to pigmentation state: anthocyanin (blue), betalain (pink) and unknown (grey). (b) Mirror image of pigment reconstruction topology. A black star marks the initial DODA\nalpha/DODA\nbeta duplication. Purple stars indicate inferred phylogenetic locations of DODA\nalpha gene duplications giving rise to paralogues with high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Black crosses indicate loss of a DODAalpha paralogue. Tips show inferred presence or absence of DODA\nalpha/DODA\nbeta: black squares indicate presence of DODA\nalpha/DODA\nbeta, white squares with a cross indicate loss of DODA\nalpha, and white squares with a dashed boundary indicate missing data; DODAalpha squares coloured purple are inferred to have high L-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity.\n\n---\n\nPolyphyletic origins of betalain pigmentation occur only within Caryophyllales (Fig. 2), while polyphyletic origins of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity are constrained to the Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha clade (Fig. 6). Both patterns link to the concept of evolutionary precursors in which underlying evolutionary state(s) potentiate recurrent evolution of subsequent complex traits (sensu Marazzi et al., 2012). In this scenario, we propose that an initial precursor step was the evolution of tyrosine hydroxylase activity by duplication in the CYP76AD lineage, leading to an abundance of l-DOPA (DeLoache et al., 2015; Polturak et al., 2016; Sunnadeniya et al., 2016), the necessary substrate for betalamic acid biosynthesis. Given an abundance of l-DOPA, a subsequent precursor step was duplication in the DODA lineage that gave rise to a clade of DODAalpha enzymes, whose ancestral function is currently unknown, but presumably with some promiscuous ability to act on l-DOPA to produce trace betalamic acid. Subsequently, further repeated duplication within the DODAalpha lineage led to recurrent neofunctionalisation towards high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the production of betalamic acid."

			"context": "Previously, Lopez-Nieves et al. (2018) speculated that the evolution of tyrosine-derived betalains occurred in a metabolic environment enriched for tyrosine. The arogenate dehydrogenase enzyme (ADHalpha) responsible for increased tyrosine availability is also lost and/or down-regulated in the anthocyanic Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae lineages (Lopez-Nieves et al., 2018). Therefore, the shift to anthocyanins in these taxa may indicate deeper shifts away from a tyrosine-rich metabolism towards a metabolism in which phenylalanine plays a canonical role. The primary function of the DODAalpha paralogues with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity is unknown, but may catalyse production of tyrosine-derived metabolites, other than betalains. In this scenario, the duplication that gave rise to the DODAbeta and DODAalpha lineages led to neofunctionalisation in the DODAalpha lineage towards an unknown but tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, with marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Loss of DODA alpha in Caryophyllaceae and Molluginaceae could instead reflect loss of the unknown tyrosine-derived enzymatic activity, in the context of shifts towards more phenylalanine-biased metabolism, independent of origins of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity.\n\n---\n\nIn contrast to the anthocyanin pathway, the betalain biosynthetic pathway is relatively simple, involving as few as four enzymatic steps to proceed from tyrosine to stable betalain pigments: yellow betaxanthins and violet betacyanins (Fig. 1).

The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments. l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family (Christinet et al., 2004). Within Caryophyllales, a gene duplication in the LigB/DODA gene lineage gave rise to the DODAalpha and DODAbeta clades, with l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity previously inferred to have evolved at the base of the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). On the basis of this Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, and subsequent losses of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages, we previously argued for a single origin of betalain pigmentation, with multiple reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015)."

Both patterns link to the concept of evolutionary precursors in which underlying evolutionary state(s) potentiate recurrent evolution of subsequent complex traits (sensu Marazzi et al., 2012). In this scenario, we propose that an initial precursor step was the evolution of tyrosine hydroxylase activity by duplication in the CYP76AD lineage, leading to an abundance of l-DOPA (DeLoache et al., 2015; Polturak et al., 2016; Sunnadeniya et al., 2016), the necessary substrate for betalamic acid biosynthesis. Given an abundance of l-DOPA, a subsequent precursor step was duplication in the DODA lineage that gave rise to a clade of DODAalpha enzymes, whose ancestral function is currently unknown, but presumably with some promiscuous ability to act on l-DOPA to produce trace betalamic acid. Subsequently, further repeated duplication within the DODAalpha lineage led to recurrent neofunctionalisation towards high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the production of betalamic acid."

			"context": "However, evolutionary patterns within the DODAalpha lineage are complex (Brockington et al., 2015). In addition to the DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, there have been at least nine duplications in the DODAalpha lineage resulting in all betalain-pigmented lineages of Caryophyllales containing at least three DODA genes - at least one homologue from the DODAbeta lineage and at least two paralogues from the DODAalpha lineage, with Beta vulgaris containing five copies of DODA alpha. In B. vulgaris, only two DODAalpha paralogues have been studied (Sasaki et al., 2009; Gandia-Herrero & Garcia-Carmona, 2012; Hatlestad et al., 2012; Chung et al., 2015; Bean et al., 2018), with one paralogue, BvDODA1 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha1), found to exhibit high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the other paralogue, BvDODA2 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha2), exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Bean et al. (2018) compared BvDODAalpha1 and BvDODAalpha2 and identified seven divergent residues that, when altered in BvDODAalpha2, were sufficient to allow BvDODAalpha2 to convert l-DOPA to betalamic acid in yeast. Like BvDODAalpha2, two DODAalpha paralogues from other species (Parakeelya mirabilis and a Ptilotus hybrid) have also been shown to have limited or no capacity to produce betalamic acid (Chung et al., 2015). Extensive gene duplication within the DODAalpha lineage and the conserved presence of paralogues exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity suggests further sub- and/or neofunctionalisation events occurring within the DODAalpha clade, although the evolutionary significance of this is unclear.\n\n---\n\nThe betalain biosynthetic pathway.

In addition to the DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, there have been at least nine duplications in the DODAalpha lineage resulting in all betalain-pigmented lineages of Caryophyllales containing at least three DODA genes - at least one homologue from the DODAbeta lineage and at least two paralogues from the DODAalpha lineage, with Beta vulgaris containing five copies of DODA alpha. In B. vulgaris, only two DODAalpha paralogues have been studied (Sasaki et al., 2009; Gandia-Herrero & Garcia-Carmona, 2012; Hatlestad et al., 2012; Chung et al., 2015; Bean et al., 2018), with one paralogue, BvDODA1 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha1), found to exhibit high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the other paralogue, BvDODA2 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha2), exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity.

Like BvDODAalpha2, two DODAalpha paralogues from other species (Parakeelya mirabilis and a Ptilotus hybrid) have also been shown to have limited or no capacity to produce betalamic acid (Chung et al., 2015). Extensive gene duplication within the DODAalpha lineage and the conserved presence of paralogues exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity suggests further sub- and/or neofunctionalisation events occurring within the DODAalpha clade, although the evolutionary significance of this is unclear.\n\n---\n\nIn contrast to the anthocyanin pathway, the betalain biosynthetic pathway is relatively simple, involving as few as four enzymatic steps to proceed from tyrosine to stable betalain pigments: yellow betaxanthins and violet betacyanins (Fig. 1).

The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments. l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family (Christinet et al., 2004). Within Caryophyllales, a gene duplication in the LigB/DODA gene lineage gave rise to the DODAalpha and DODAbeta clades, with l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity previously inferred to have evolved at the base of the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). On the basis of this Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, and subsequent losses of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages, we previously argued for a single origin of betalain pigmentation, with multiple reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015)."

			"context": "Polyphyletic origins of betalain pigmentation occur only within Caryophyllales (Fig. 2), while polyphyletic origins of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity are constrained to the Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha clade (Fig. 6). Both patterns link to the concept of evolutionary precursors in which underlying evolutionary state(s) potentiate recurrent evolution of subsequent complex traits (sensu Marazzi et al., 2012). In this scenario, we propose that an initial precursor step was the evolution of tyrosine hydroxylase activity by duplication in the CYP76AD lineage, leading to an abundance of l-DOPA (DeLoache et al., 2015; Polturak et al., 2016; Sunnadeniya et al., 2016), the necessary substrate for betalamic acid biosynthesis. Given an abundance of l-DOPA, a subsequent precursor step was duplication in the DODA lineage that gave rise to a clade of DODAalpha enzymes, whose ancestral function is currently unknown, but presumably with some promiscuous ability to act on l-DOPA to produce trace betalamic acid. Subsequently, further repeated duplication within the DODAalpha lineage led to recurrent neofunctionalisation towards high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the production of betalamic acid.\n\n---\n\nHowever, evolutionary patterns within the DODAalpha lineage are complex (Brockington et al., 2015).

In addition to the DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, there have been at least nine duplications in the DODAalpha lineage resulting in all betalain-pigmented lineages of Caryophyllales containing at least three DODA genes - at least one homologue from the DODAbeta lineage and at least two paralogues from the DODAalpha lineage, with Beta vulgaris containing five copies of DODA alpha. In B. vulgaris, only two DODAalpha paralogues have been studied (Sasaki et al., 2009; Gandia-Herrero & Garcia-Carmona, 2012; Hatlestad et al., 2012; Chung et al., 2015; Bean et al., 2018), with one paralogue, BvDODA1 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha1), found to exhibit high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the other paralogue, BvDODA2 (hereafter termed BvDODAalpha2), exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. Bean et al. (2018) compared BvDODAalpha1 and BvDODAalpha2 and identified seven divergent residues that, when altered in BvDODAalpha2, were sufficient to allow BvDODAalpha2 to convert l-DOPA to betalamic acid in yeast. Like BvDODAalpha2, two DODAalpha paralogues from other species (Parakeelya mirabilis and a Ptilotus hybrid) have also been shown to have limited or no capacity to produce betalamic acid (Chung et al., 2015). Extensive gene duplication within the DODAalpha lineage and the conserved presence of paralogues exhibiting no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity suggests further sub- and/or neofunctionalisation events occurring within the DODAalpha clade, although the evolutionary significance of this is unclear.\n\n---\n\nUsing the same procedure as that used to test the DODAbeta enzymes, we found that only a single DODAalpha from each study species showed a strong production of betalain pigmentation including BvDODAalpha1 (Figs 3, S8-S11).

The core genes encoding betalain synthesis enzymes have been elucidated, primarily through heterologous assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana, which has emerged as an essential tool for betalain research in planta (Polturak et al., 2016; Timoneda et al., 2018). The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments. l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family (Christinet et al., 2004). Within Caryophyllales, a gene duplication in the LigB/DODA gene lineage gave rise to the DODAalpha and DODAbeta clades, with l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity previously inferred to have evolved at the base of the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). On the basis of this Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, and subsequent losses of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages, we previously argued for a single origin of betalain pigmentation, with multiple reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015)."

			"justification": "The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments.",
			"context": "In contrast to the anthocyanin pathway, the betalain biosynthetic pathway is relatively simple, involving as few as four enzymatic steps to proceed from tyrosine to stable betalain pigments: yellow betaxanthins and violet betacyanins (Fig. 1). The core genes encoding betalain synthesis enzymes have been elucidated, primarily through heterologous assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Nicotiana benthamiana, which has emerged as an essential tool for betalain research in planta (Polturak et al., 2016; Timoneda et al., 2018). The key enzymatic step in betalain biosynthesis involves conversion of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to betalamic acid, the central chromophore of betalain pigments. l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase is encoded by the gene DODA, a member of the LigB gene family (Christinet et al., 2004). Within Caryophyllales, a gene duplication in the LigB/DODA gene lineage gave rise to the DODAalpha and DODAbeta clades, with l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity previously inferred to have evolved at the base of the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). On the basis of this Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha/DODAbeta duplication, and subsequent losses of DODA alpha loci in anthocyanic lineages, we previously argued for a single origin of betalain pigmentation, with multiple reversals to anthocyanin pigmentation (Brockington et al., 2015).\n\n---\n\nUsing the same procedure as that used to test the DODAbeta enzymes, we found that only a single DODAalpha from each study species showed a strong production of betalain pigmentation including BvDODAalpha1 (Figs 3, S8-S11). All paralogues exhibiting high production of betanin in the heterologous assay (which we term as having high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity) are hereafter named \"alpha1\". The amount of betanin produced by the different orthologues of DODAalpha1 varies relative to BvDODAalpha1, indicating that there may be differences in the effectiveness of these DODAalpha enzymes to convert l-DOPA to betalamic acid (Fig. 3b). For example, ShDODAalpha1 produced a comparable amount of pigment to BvDODAalpha1, CgDODAalpha1 produced c. 60% as much as BvDODAalpha1, and McDODAalpha1 produced c. 80% more than BvDODAalpha1."

			"context": "Polyphyletic origins of betalain pigmentation occur only within Caryophyllales (Fig. 2), while polyphyletic origins of high l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity are constrained to the Caryophyllales-specific DODAalpha clade (Fig. 6). Both patterns link to the concept of evolutionary precursors in which underlying evolutionary state(s) potentiate recurrent evolution of subsequent complex traits (sensu Marazzi et al., 2012). In this scenario, we propose that an initial precursor step was the evolution of tyrosine hydroxylase activity by duplication in the CYP76AD lineage, leading to an abundance of l-DOPA (DeLoache et al., 2015; Polturak et al., 2016; Sunnadeniya et al., 2016), the necessary substrate for betalamic acid biosynthesis. Given an abundance of l-DOPA, a subsequent precursor step was duplication in the DODA lineage that gave rise to a clade of DODAalpha enzymes, whose ancestral function is currently unknown, but presumably with some promiscuous ability to act on l-DOPA to produce trace betalamic acid. Subsequently, further repeated duplication within the DODAalpha lineage led to recurrent neofunctionalisation towards high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and the production of betalamic acid."

			"context": "We found that in each betalain-pigmented species there is at least one DODAalpha paralogue that exhibits marginal activity (consistent with Chung et al., 2015 and Bean et al., 2018). For example, in M. crystallinum, pigmentation was also observed for McDODAalpha2, albeit at a much lower level than DODAalpha1 from M. crystallinum or any other species (Figs 3a,b, S8-S11). Depending on the strength of transient expression in particular leaves, faint pigment was also sometimes observed for BvDODAalpha2 and CgDODAalpha2, from B. vulgaris and C. gigantea respectively (Fig. 3a). Quantification of betanin in these infiltration spots showed that McDODAalpha2 produced c. 5% the amount of betanin as BvDODAalpha1, whereas BvDODAalpha2 and CgDODAalpha2 showed below 3% the amount of BvDODAalpha1 (Figs 3b, S9-S11). Despite being visually undetectable, betanin could also be detected by HPLC in ShDODAalpha2 and BvDODAalpha4 (Figs 3b, S8, S9). For two B. vulgaris paralogues, BvDODAalpha3 and BvDODAalpha5, betanin was undetectable (Figs 3b, S9). DODAalpha enzymes from anthocyanic species M. australis and K. caespitosa were also found to produce a small amount of betanin, as detected by HPLC (Figs 4, S12). MaDODAalpha produces c. 2.5% the amount of BvDODAalpha1, and KcDODAalpha1 and KcDODAalpha2 produce c. 12% and 2% of BvDODAalpha1, respectively. Within Caryophyllaceae, DODAalpha from C. ramosissimum and T. imperati produced a small amount of betanin (6% and 2.5% of BvDODAalpha1, respectively; Figs 4b,c, S12).\n\n---\n\nTo explore the hypothesis of multiple origins of betalain pigmentation suggested by our reconstructions, we then selected four species that represent each of the putative origins: S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea. Using heterologous transient assays, we inferred relative levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity based on the proxy of betanin production (Fig. 3). Our data show that activity is barely detectable in DODAbeta loci from betalain-pigmented species, supporting our original hypothesis that the high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity evolved exclusively within the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). However, although betalain-pigmented species have multiple paralogues of DODAalpha genes, only one of these DODAalpha in each species encodes a protein which exhibits high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. All betalain-pigmented species also exhibit DODAalpha paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and we also detected marginal activity in several anthocyanic taxa (Fig. 4). Thus, marginal activity is widespread among Caryophyllales DODAalpha enzymes, suggesting broader underlying catalytic promiscuity in the DODAalpha lineage. Catalytic promiscuity is well documented in the broader protocatechuate dioxygenase gene family of which the LigB/DODA lineage is a member (Burroughs et al., 2019). Such promiscuity is an important feature of metabolic evolution, potentially conferring evolvability (Weng & Noel, 2012; Leong & Last, 2017), and may have significant implications for the recurrent evolution of betalain pigmentation, as discussed below."

C. Yim, unpublished) and C. gigantea (Cactaceae; Copetti et al., 2017). S. halimifolium, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea each contain one DODAbeta and two DODA alpha genes, and B. vulgaris contains one DODAbeta and five DODA alpha genes (Figs S5, S6). The DODA genes for all four species were separately cloned into multigene vectors containing all necessary genes for betalain biosynthesis and these vectors were transiently transformed into N. benthamiana to test their heterologous expression (Fig. S1; Timoneda et al., 2018). We used the production of betacyanin in this heterologous assay as a proxy for l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, with the relative strength of betacyanin production indicating the relative strength of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity between loci. Upon heterologous expression, none of the DODAbeta genes from S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea produced visible betacyanin pigmentation (Fig. 3a; Timoneda et al., 2018). Traces of betanin were detected for all loci by HPLC, but amounts were extremely low compared to the positive control, BvDODAalpha1 (< 0.1%; Fig. 3b).\n\n---\n\nUsing the same procedure as that used to test the DODAbeta enzymes, we found that only a single DODAalpha from each study species showed a strong production of betalain pigmentation including BvDODAalpha1 (Figs 3, S8-S11). All paralogues exhibiting high production of betanin in the heterologous assay (which we term as having high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity) are hereafter named \"alpha1\". The amount of betanin produced by the different orthologues of DODAalpha1 varies relative to BvDODAalpha1, indicating that there may be differences in the effectiveness of these DODAalpha enzymes to convert l-DOPA to betalamic acid (Fig. 3b). For example, ShDODAalpha1 produced a comparable amount of pigment to BvDODAalpha1, CgDODAalpha1 produced c. 60% as much as BvDODAalpha1, and McDODAalpha1 produced c. 80% more than BvDODAalpha1.\n\n---\n\nTo explore the hypothesis of multiple origins of betalain pigmentation suggested by our reconstructions, we then selected four species that represent each of the putative origins: S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea. Using heterologous transient assays, we inferred relative levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity based on the proxy of betanin production (Fig. 3). Our data show that activity is barely detectable in DODAbeta loci from betalain-pigmented species, supporting our original hypothesis that the high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity evolved exclusively within the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). However, although betalain-pigmented species have multiple paralogues of DODAalpha genes, only one of these DODAalpha in each species encodes a protein which exhibits high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. All betalain-pigmented species also exhibit DODAalpha paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and we also detected marginal activity in several anthocyanic taxa (Fig. 4). Thus, marginal activity is widespread among Caryophyllales DODAalpha enzymes, suggesting broader underlying catalytic promiscuity in the DODAalpha lineage. Catalytic promiscuity is well documented in the broader protocatechuate dioxygenase gene family of which the LigB/DODA lineage is a member (Burroughs et al., 2019). Such promiscuity is an important feature of metabolic evolution, potentially conferring evolvability (Weng & Noel, 2012; Leong & Last, 2017), and may have significant implications for the recurrent evolution of betalain pigmentation, as discussed below."

The data were combined after calculating relative amounts (RQ) for each species from individual species-specific experiments (Supporting Information Figs S8-S11). Bars show means +- SD; n = 5 for S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, C. gigantea and M. crystallinum, except for BvDODAalpha2 (n = 4) and BvDODAalpha3 (n = 4). (c) A representative HPLC trace for the DODA\nalpha\n1 gene from each species. The left peak is betanin and the right peak is its isomer, isobetanin. The traces are offset for presentation. 'pLUC' is a negative control plasmid carrying the firefly luciferase gene and 'Betanin' is a commercially available extract from beet hypocotyl which was used to validate the retention time of betanin in these samples.\n\n---\n\nWe found that in each betalain-pigmented species there is at least one DODAalpha paralogue that exhibits marginal activity (consistent with Chung et al., 2015 and Bean et al., 2018). For example, in M. crystallinum, pigmentation was also observed for McDODAalpha2, albeit at a much lower level than DODAalpha1 from M. crystallinum or any other species (Figs 3a,b, S8-S11). Depending on the strength of transient expression in particular leaves, faint pigment was also sometimes observed for BvDODAalpha2 and CgDODAalpha2, from B. vulgaris and C. gigantea respectively (Fig. 3a). Quantification of betanin in these infiltration spots showed that McDODAalpha2 produced c. 5% the amount of betanin as BvDODAalpha1, whereas BvDODAalpha2 and CgDODAalpha2 showed below 3% the amount of BvDODAalpha1 (Figs 3b, S9-S11). Despite being visually undetectable, betanin could also be detected by HPLC in ShDODAalpha2 and BvDODAalpha4 (Figs 3b, S8, S9). For two B. vulgaris paralogues, BvDODAalpha3 and BvDODAalpha5, betanin was undetectable (Figs 3b, S9). DODAalpha enzymes from anthocyanic species M. australis and K. caespitosa were also found to produce a small amount of betanin, as detected by HPLC (Figs 4, S12). MaDODAalpha produces c. 2.5% the amount of BvDODAalpha1, and KcDODAalpha1 and KcDODAalpha2 produce c. 12% and 2% of BvDODAalpha1, respectively. Within Caryophyllaceae, DODAalpha from C. ramosissimum and T. imperati produced a small amount of betanin (6% and 2.5% of BvDODAalpha1, respectively; Figs 4b,c, S12).\n\n---\n\nTo explore the hypothesis of multiple origins of betalain pigmentation suggested by our reconstructions, we then selected four species that represent each of the putative origins: S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea. Using heterologous transient assays, we inferred relative levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity based on the proxy of betanin production (Fig. 3). Our data show that activity is barely detectable in DODAbeta loci from betalain-pigmented species, supporting our original hypothesis that the high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity evolved exclusively within the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). However, although betalain-pigmented species have multiple paralogues of DODAalpha genes, only one of these DODAalpha in each species encodes a protein which exhibits high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. All betalain-pigmented species also exhibit DODAalpha paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and we also detected marginal activity in several anthocyanic taxa (Fig. 4). Thus, marginal activity is widespread among Caryophyllales DODAalpha enzymes, suggesting broader underlying catalytic promiscuity in the DODAalpha lineage. Catalytic promiscuity is well documented in the broader protocatechuate dioxygenase gene family of which the LigB/DODA lineage is a member (Burroughs et al., 2019). Such promiscuity is an important feature of metabolic evolution, potentially conferring evolvability (Weng & Noel, 2012; Leong & Last, 2017), and may have significant implications for the recurrent evolution of betalain pigmentation, as discussed below."

C. Yim, unpublished) and C. gigantea (Cactaceae; Copetti et al., 2017). S. halimifolium, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea each contain one DODAbeta and two DODA alpha genes, and B. vulgaris contains one DODAbeta and five DODA alpha genes (Figs S5, S6). The DODA genes for all four species were separately cloned into multigene vectors containing all necessary genes for betalain biosynthesis and these vectors were transiently transformed into N. benthamiana to test their heterologous expression (Fig. S1; Timoneda et al., 2018). We used the production of betacyanin in this heterologous assay as a proxy for l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity, with the relative strength of betacyanin production indicating the relative strength of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity between loci. Upon heterologous expression, none of the DODAbeta genes from S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea produced visible betacyanin pigmentation (Fig. 3a; Timoneda et al., 2018).

Using heterologous transient assays, we inferred relative levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity based on the proxy of betanin production (Fig. 3). Our data show that activity is barely detectable in DODAbeta loci from betalain-pigmented species, supporting our original hypothesis that the high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity evolved exclusively within the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). However, although betalain-pigmented species have multiple paralogues of DODAalpha genes, only one of these DODAalpha in each species encodes a protein which exhibits high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. All betalain-pigmented species also exhibit DODAalpha paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and we also detected marginal activity in several anthocyanic taxa (Fig. 4). Thus, marginal activity is widespread among Caryophyllales DODAalpha enzymes, suggesting broader underlying catalytic promiscuity in the DODAalpha lineage. Catalytic promiscuity is well documented in the broader protocatechuate dioxygenase gene family of which the LigB/DODA lineage is a member (Burroughs et al., 2019). Such promiscuity is an important feature of metabolic evolution, potentially conferring evolvability (Weng & Noel, 2012; Leong & Last, 2017), and may have significant implications for the recurrent evolution of betalain pigmentation, as discussed below."

			"context": "To explore the hypothesis of multiple origins of betalain pigmentation suggested by our reconstructions, we then selected four species that represent each of the putative origins: S. halimifolium, B. vulgaris, M. crystallinum and C. gigantea. Using heterologous transient assays, we inferred relative levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity based on the proxy of betanin production (Fig. 3). Our data show that activity is barely detectable in DODAbeta loci from betalain-pigmented species, supporting our original hypothesis that the high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity evolved exclusively within the DODAalpha lineage (Brockington et al., 2015). However, although betalain-pigmented species have multiple paralogues of DODAalpha genes, only one of these DODAalpha in each species encodes a protein which exhibits high levels of l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity. All betalain-pigmented species also exhibit DODAalpha paralogues with no or only marginal l-DOPA 4,5-dioxygenase activity and we also detected marginal activity in several anthocyanic taxa (Fig. 4). Thus, marginal activity is widespread among Caryophyllales DODAalpha enzymes, suggesting broader underlying catalytic promiscuity in the DODAalpha lineage. Catalytic promiscuity is well documented in the broader protocatechuate dioxygenase gene family of which the LigB/DODA lineage is a member (Burroughs et al., 2019). Such promiscuity is an important feature of metabolic evolution, potentially conferring evolvability (Weng & Noel, 2012; Leong & Last, 2017), and may have significant implications for the recurrent evolution of betalain pigmentation, as discussed below."
