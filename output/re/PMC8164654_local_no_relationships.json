      "context": "Over the last two decades, many studies have been conducted to understand the morpho-physiological and biochemical effects of UV-B light in plants and to reveal the mechanisms of resistance especially in UV-sensitive economically important higher plants. Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Previous studies reported that different rice cultivars are sensitive to UV-B radiation although belonging to the same ecotype. In this study, we reported the positive impact of exogenous application of beta-sitosterol (betaSito) on rice plants subjected to prolonged UV-B irradiation. Our results demonstrate that betaSito could significantly improve various aspects of growth and development when plants were subjected to UV-B stress and thus play a vital role in UV tolerance mechanisms in rice plants. The rice plants treated with betaSito (Sbeta plants) maintained their normal functions specifically photosynthesis-related processes that are generally sensitive to any stress conditions. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly higher in Sbetauvs plants than in Nbetauvs plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 2). Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants. It is important to mention that the sterol biosynthetic pathway in plants is complex that begins with squalene and is followed by its conversion to various end products. The positive role of different forms of sterols in various abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought stress has also been reported earlier."

      "context": "Rice is an exceptionally important staple food which is grown worldwide due to its high demand and economic value. Given the fact that UV-B stress can negatively affect numerous morpho-physiological events and metabolic profile in different plant species as reported in earlier studies. Notably, rice cultivars also show extreme sensitivity to UV-B light, and thus, more efforts are required in finding ways to improve resistance and maintain high productivity of rice. Recent efforts to enhance rice tolerance for UV-B stress are largely associated with transgenic approaches. Nonetheless, the development of transgenic plants is a long-term and expensive process. On the other hand, the exogenous application of phytosterols in research for improving abiotic stress tolerance in rice holds many advantages such as higher effectiveness, low cost of handling, and its environmentally friendly attribute. Considering all these points in mind, we attempt to explore the effects of supplementation of betaSito on metabolic and physiological processes in rice plants subjected to prolonged UV-B stress. To the best of our knowledge, such study is conducted for the first time to reveal the molecular mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance conferred through exogenous application of betaSito in rice plants. Therefore, our specific goals for conducting this research were (1) whether betaSito could really enhance tolerance of rice plants under prolonged UV-B irradiation and (2) to evaluate oxidative damages in betaSito treated and untreated plants, further (3) to investigate and compare physiological parameters and metabolite changes in rice plants with or without betaSito both under non-stress and UV-B stress."

      "context": "Of all the biological processes, photosynthesis is the central and most crucial process for measuring the physiological characteristics of plants under various environmental challenges. Any change in photosynthetic-related parameters affects the overall sensitivity of photosynthesis and subsequently changes the plant physiology. In this study, almost 27.78% increase in Pn was recorded in Sbetauvs (vs. Sbetans) plants exposed to UV-B stress; however, no change was seen in WUEi, but Tr was reduced slightly after stress (Fig. 3). A similar increasing trend was noted for Gs, Fv/Fm, and NPQ in Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans plants after stress (Fig. 3). Furthermore, under non-stress conditions, Pn, Fv/Fm, and WUEi were also enhanced in Sbetans vs. Nbetans. In contrast, photosynthesis was negatively affected in Nbetauvs plants, and as we expected, the values for all these parameters were significantly reduced in Nbetauvs plants after UV-B irradiation (Fig. 3). In case of Pn, almost 52.20% and 26.67% reduction (Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs and Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, respectively) was observed in Nbetauvs plants (Fig. 3A). Notably, this result was also consistent with reduced chlorophyll content and a decrease of plant biomass in Nbetauvs plants. In conclusion, these results clearly indicate the positive effects of betaSito application on net photosynthesis and associated gas exchange parameters in Sbeta plants under prolonged UV-B irradiation.

      "context": "Photosynthetic pigments Chl a, Chl b, and Caro are important for capturing light to perform efficient photosynthesis and are good indicators for plant adaptability to stress conditions. Therefore, we measured the content of these pigments in Nbeta and Sbeta plants under non-stress and UV-B stress. Under non-stress conditions, there were no significant differences for all the photosynthetic pigments between Nbetans and Sbetans plants except for Caro, contents of which were relatively increased in Sbetans plants (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, there was a significant reduction in the levels of Chl a, Chl b, total chlorophyll, and Caro in Nbetauvs plants after exposure to UV-B stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs). Conversely, we have found that the contents of Chl a, total chlorophyll, and Caro in Sbetauvs plants were significantly higher (Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs), whereas the content of Chl b was relatively constant (Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans) after stress (Fig. 2A-D). Moreover, we have also examined any effects on the ultrastructure of chloroplast in Nbeta and Sbeta plants subjected to prolonged UV-B stress. For this purpose, we make use of transmission electron microscopy which shows disorganization of grana stacks in the chloroplasts of leaves from Nbetauvs plants after exposure to prolonged UV-B irradiation, while no significant effect was observed in Sbetauvs as compared to non-stress plants (Fig. 2E). Collectively, the results demonstrated that betaSito was involved in maintaining chloroplast development and chlorophyll synthesis under stress conditions thus showing superior performance of Sbeta plants compared to Nbeta plants.

      "context": "Over the last two decades, many studies have been conducted to understand the morpho-physiological and biochemical effects of UV-B light in plants and to reveal the mechanisms of resistance especially in UV-sensitive economically important higher plants. Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Previous studies reported that different rice cultivars are sensitive to UV-B radiation although belonging to the same ecotype. In this study, we reported the positive impact of exogenous application of beta-sitosterol (betaSito) on rice plants subjected to prolonged UV-B irradiation. Our results demonstrate that betaSito could significantly improve various aspects of growth and development when plants were subjected to UV-B stress and thus play a vital role in UV tolerance mechanisms in rice plants. The rice plants treated with betaSito (Sbeta plants) maintained their normal functions specifically photosynthesis-related processes that are generally sensitive to any stress conditions. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly higher in Sbetauvs plants than in Nbetauvs plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 2). Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants. It is important to mention that the sterol biosynthetic pathway in plants is complex that begins with squalene and is followed by its conversion to various end products. The positive role of different forms of sterols in various abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought stress has also been reported earlier."

      "context": "In this study, we concluded that exogenous application of the beta-sitosterol contributes positively to plant growth and stress signaling in rice plants during prolonged UV-B stress. The shoot length and root length was not affected in Sbeta plants under UV-B stress (Sbetauvs); however, a sharp decline in the shoot (57.15% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, 64% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs) and root (40% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, 42% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs) length was recorded in Nbetauvs plants. As a result, we found a substantial decrease of plant biomass in Nbetauvs plants, i.e., nearly 52% lower as compared with Sbetauvs plants under prolonged UV-B irradiation stress. The photosynthetic-associated characteristics were also measured which show a 27.78% increase of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in Sbetauvs plants (vs. non-stress plants). Other related parameters also show an increasing trend such as Gs, Fv/Fm, and NPQ in Sbeta plants after stress is applied. In contrast, 52.20% and 26.67% reduction in Pn (Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs and Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, respectively) was observed in Nbetauvs plants. Consistently, photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll and carotenoids were higher in Sbeta plants; however, pigment contents were significantly reduced in Nbeta plants after stress. All these findings show a positive correlation of beta-sitosterol application with growth- and development-related characteristics in rice plants during prolonged UV-B stress. Another important part of this research shows that Sbeta plants exhibit more plasticity to UV-B irradiation due to stabilization of the antioxidant system in Sbeta plants. Activities of antioxidant enzymes including SOD, POD, CAT, and APX were enhanced only in Sbeta plants while decreased significantly in Nbeta plants upon UV-B exposure. Further, a significant accumulation of several core metabolites that include organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others in Sbeta plants reveals betaSito-regulated activation of non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanism in rice plants under stress. Overall, this study is beneficial especially in terms of its involvement in plant growth and development; moreover, betaSito-regulated plasticity of plants during UV-B irradiation shows that its application could further be explored specifically in relation to different environmental stresses in other economically useful crop plants."

Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Previous studies reported that different rice cultivars are sensitive to UV-B radiation although belonging to the same ecotype. In this study, we reported the positive impact of exogenous application of beta-sitosterol (betaSito) on rice plants subjected to prolonged UV-B irradiation. Our results demonstrate that betaSito could significantly improve various aspects of growth and development when plants were subjected to UV-B stress and thus play a vital role in UV tolerance mechanisms in rice plants. The rice plants treated with betaSito (Sbeta plants) maintained their normal functions specifically photosynthesis-related processes that are generally sensitive to any stress conditions. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly higher in Sbetauvs plants than in Nbetauvs plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 2). Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants. It is important to mention that the sterol biosynthetic pathway in plants is complex that begins with squalene and is followed by its conversion to various end products. The positive role of different forms of sterols in various abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought stress has also been reported earlier."

As a result, we found a substantial decrease of plant biomass in Nbetauvs plants, i.e., nearly 52% lower as compared with Sbetauvs plants under prolonged UV-B irradiation stress. The photosynthetic-associated characteristics were also measured which show a 27.78% increase of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in Sbetauvs plants (vs. non-stress plants). Other related parameters also show an increasing trend such as Gs, Fv/Fm, and NPQ in Sbeta plants after stress is applied. In contrast, 52.20% and 26.67% reduction in Pn (Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs and Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, respectively) was observed in Nbetauvs plants.

All these findings show a positive correlation of beta-sitosterol application with growth- and development-related characteristics in rice plants during prolonged UV-B stress.

Activities of antioxidant enzymes including SOD, POD, CAT, and APX were enhanced only in Sbeta plants while decreased significantly in Nbeta plants upon UV-B exposure. Further, a significant accumulation of several core metabolites that include organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others in Sbeta plants reveals betaSito-regulated activation of non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanism in rice plants under stress.

      "context": "Over the last two decades, many studies have been conducted to understand the morpho-physiological and biochemical effects of UV-B light in plants and to reveal the mechanisms of resistance especially in UV-sensitive economically important higher plants. Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Previous studies reported that different rice cultivars are sensitive to UV-B radiation although belonging to the same ecotype. In this study, we reported the positive impact of exogenous application of beta-sitosterol (betaSito) on rice plants subjected to prolonged UV-B irradiation. Our results demonstrate that betaSito could significantly improve various aspects of growth and development when plants were subjected to UV-B stress and thus play a vital role in UV tolerance mechanisms in rice plants. The rice plants treated with betaSito (Sbeta plants) maintained their normal functions specifically photosynthesis-related processes that are generally sensitive to any stress conditions. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly higher in Sbetauvs plants than in Nbetauvs plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 2). Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants. It is important to mention that the sterol biosynthetic pathway in plants is complex that begins with squalene and is followed by its conversion to various end products. The positive role of different forms of sterols in various abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought stress has also been reported earlier."

Overall, this study is beneficial especially in terms of its involvement in plant growth and development; moreover, betaSito-regulated plasticity of plants during UV-B irradiation shows that its application could further be explored specifically in relation to different environmental stresses in other economically useful crop plants."

The application of betaSito contributes positively under non-stress and specifically to UV-B stress in terms of improving numerous physiological parameters associated with growth and development such as shoot and root length, RWC, whole plant biomass, chlorophyll pigments, and photosynthetic-related parameters (Pn, Gs, Tr, WUEi, Fv/Fm, and NPQ) in Sbeta compared with Nbeta plants. Moreover, enhanced oxidative stress tolerance of Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants under stress was attributed to low levels of ROS and substantial trigger in activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT, and APX). Metabolic analysis was performed using GC-TOFMS, which revealed higher accumulation of several key metabolites including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, which were mainly reduced in Nbeta plants under stress vs. non-stress conditions."

The shoot length and root length was not affected in Sbeta plants under UV-B stress (Sbetauvs); however, a sharp decline in the shoot (57.15% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, 64% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs) and root (40% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, 42% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs) length was recorded in Nbetauvs plants. As a result, we found a substantial decrease of plant biomass in Nbetauvs plants, i.e., nearly 52% lower as compared with Sbetauvs plants under prolonged UV-B irradiation stress. The photosynthetic-associated characteristics were also measured which show a 27.78% increase of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in Sbetauvs plants (vs. non-stress plants). Other related parameters also show an increasing trend such as Gs, Fv/Fm, and NPQ in Sbeta plants after stress is applied. In contrast, 52.20% and 26.67% reduction in Pn (Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs and Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, respectively) was observed in Nbetauvs plants. Consistently, photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll and carotenoids were higher in Sbeta plants; however, pigment contents were significantly reduced in Nbeta plants after stress. All these findings show a positive correlation of beta-sitosterol application with growth- and development-related characteristics in rice plants during prolonged UV-B stress. Another important part of this research shows that Sbeta plants exhibit more plasticity to UV-B irradiation due to stabilization of the antioxidant system in Sbeta plants.

Further, a significant accumulation of several core metabolites that include organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others in Sbeta plants reveals betaSito-regulated activation of non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanism in rice plants under stress. Overall, this study is beneficial especially in terms of its involvement in plant growth and development; moreover, betaSito-regulated plasticity of plants during UV-B irradiation shows that its application could further be explored specifically in relation to different environmental stresses in other economically useful crop plants."

In higher plants, a wide variety of secondary metabolites (alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, etc.) are synthesized from primary metabolites (such as sugars, lipids, and amino acids). In plants, differential accumulation of a variety of metabolites is not directly related to their central energy metabolism or structural integrity. In fact, plant metabolites and their distribution and diversity are reflective of their essential functions in plant stress response. Furthermore, the increase of different metabolites in stressed plants is a non-enzymatic mechanism to enhance antioxidant capability in plants. Generally, these diverse solutes exhibit a high level of solubility in the cellular milieu, and their accumulation does not affect enzyme activities even at high concentrations. Moreover, the chemical nature of these osmoprotectants is very diverse that includes amino acids (proline, leucine, iso-leucine, tryptophan), amines, and gamma-amino-N-butyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, fructose) and polyols (inositol, myo-inositol), as well as different organic acids (oxalic acid, salicylic acid, ferulaic acid, etc.), accumulate in response to osmotic stress in plants."

      "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

      "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

Furthermore, the increase of different metabolites in stressed plants is a non-enzymatic mechanism to enhance antioxidant capability in plants. Generally, these diverse solutes exhibit a high level of solubility in the cellular milieu, and their accumulation does not affect enzyme activities even at high concentrations. Moreover, the chemical nature of these osmoprotectants is very diverse that includes amino acids (proline, leucine, iso-leucine, tryptophan), amines, and gamma-amino-N-butyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, fructose) and polyols (inositol, myo-inositol), as well as different organic acids (oxalic acid, salicylic acid, ferulaic acid, etc.), accumulate in response to osmotic stress in plants."

      "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

In higher plants, a wide variety of secondary metabolites (alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, etc.) are synthesized from primary metabolites (such as sugars, lipids, and amino acids). In plants, differential accumulation of a variety of metabolites is not directly related to their central energy metabolism or structural integrity. In fact, plant metabolites and their distribution and diversity are reflective of their essential functions in plant stress response. Furthermore, the increase of different metabolites in stressed plants is a non-enzymatic mechanism to enhance antioxidant capability in plants. Generally, these diverse solutes exhibit a high level of solubility in the cellular milieu, and their accumulation does not affect enzyme activities even at high concentrations. Moreover, the chemical nature of these osmoprotectants is very diverse that includes amino acids (proline, leucine, iso-leucine, tryptophan), amines, and gamma-amino-N-butyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, fructose) and polyols (inositol, myo-inositol), as well as different organic acids (oxalic acid, salicylic acid, ferulaic acid, etc.), accumulate in response to osmotic stress in plants."

      "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

      "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress.\nInterestingly, plants accumulate several metabolites (primary and secondary metabolites) in order to protect the plants from adverse conditions caused by various abiotic stresses including UV-B irradiation. In higher plants, a wide variety of secondary metabolites (alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, etc.) are synthesized from primary metabolites (such as sugars, lipids, and amino acids). In plants, differential accumulation of a variety of metabolites is not directly related to their central energy metabolism or structural integrity. In fact, plant metabolites and their distribution and diversity are reflective of their essential functions in plant stress response. Furthermore, the increase of different metabolites in stressed plants is a non-enzymatic mechanism to enhance antioxidant capability in plants. Generally, these diverse solutes exhibit a high level of solubility in the cellular milieu, and their accumulation does not affect enzyme activities even at high concentrations. Moreover, the chemical nature of these osmoprotectants is very diverse that includes amino acids (proline, leucine, iso-leucine, tryptophan), amines, and gamma-amino-N-butyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, fructose) and polyols (inositol, myo-inositol), as well as different organic acids (oxalic acid, salicylic acid, ferulaic acid, etc.), accumulate in response to osmotic stress in plants."

      "context": "Another widely recognized mechanism of plants to minimize stress-induced oxidative damage to cells and cellular components is the alteration in the levels of various metabolites which finally shape up different metabolic pathways. Since direct exposure to UV-B radiation could lower the antioxidant capacity of plants, consequently, metabolic alterations could compromise the plant defense system. In this study using the metabolomics approach by GC-TOFMS, we detected 72 key metabolites including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others in Nbeta and Sbeta plants under non-stress and after UV-B stress (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table S1). We found a significant accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, the levels of which were suppressed in Nbeta plants after stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). For organic acid metabolites in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we have observed higher accumulation such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-fold increase in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3 fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). Previous studies show that organic acid metabolites are intermediates of major carbon metabolism events such as photosynthesis and respiration in plants. Moreover, oxalic acid was reported to serve as a signaling molecule to elevate the defense level in cucumber plants. Interestingly, previous evidence show that salicylic acid positively regulates oxidative stress through the activation of antioxidant enzymes. In general, organic acids are essential for maintaining pH and redox balance in plants during the normal TCA cycle to avoid oxidative stress due to ROS."

      "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

      "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress.\nInterestingly, plants accumulate several metabolites (primary and secondary metabolites) in order to protect the plants from adverse conditions caused by various abiotic stresses including UV-B irradiation. In higher plants, a wide variety of secondary metabolites (alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, etc.) are synthesized from primary metabolites (such as sugars, lipids, and amino acids). In plants, differential accumulation of a variety of metabolites is not directly related to their central energy metabolism or structural integrity. In fact, plant metabolites and their distribution and diversity are reflective of their essential functions in plant stress response. Furthermore, the increase of different metabolites in stressed plants is a non-enzymatic mechanism to enhance antioxidant capability in plants. Generally, these diverse solutes exhibit a high level of solubility in the cellular milieu, and their accumulation does not affect enzyme activities even at high concentrations. Moreover, the chemical nature of these osmoprotectants is very diverse that includes amino acids (proline, leucine, iso-leucine, tryptophan), amines, and gamma-amino-N-butyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, fructose) and polyols (inositol, myo-inositol), as well as different organic acids (oxalic acid, salicylic acid, ferulaic acid, etc.), accumulate in response to osmotic stress in plants."

      "context": "Interestingly, plants accumulate several metabolites (primary and secondary metabolites) in order to protect the plants from adverse conditions caused by various abiotic stresses including UV-B irradiation. In higher plants, a wide variety of secondary metabolites (alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, etc.) are synthesized from primary metabolites (such as sugars, lipids, and amino acids). In plants, differential accumulation of a variety of metabolites is not directly related to their central energy metabolism or structural integrity. In fact, plant metabolites and their distribution and diversity are reflective of their essential functions in plant stress response. Furthermore, the increase of different metabolites in stressed plants is a non-enzymatic mechanism to enhance antioxidant capability in plants. Generally, these diverse solutes exhibit a high level of solubility in the cellular milieu, and their accumulation does not affect enzyme activities even at high concentrations. Moreover, the chemical nature of these osmoprotectants is very diverse that includes amino acids (proline, leucine, iso-leucine, tryptophan), amines, and gamma-amino-N-butyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, fructose) and polyols (inositol, myo-inositol), as well as different organic acids (oxalic acid, salicylic acid, ferulaic acid, etc.), accumulate in response to osmotic stress in plants.\nUV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1).

      "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress.\nInterestingly, plants accumulate several metabolites (primary and secondary metabolites) in order to protect the plants from adverse conditions caused by various abiotic stresses including UV-B irradiation. In higher plants, a wide variety of secondary metabolites (alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, etc.) are synthesized from primary metabolites (such as sugars, lipids, and amino acids). In plants, differential accumulation of a variety of metabolites is not directly related to their central energy metabolism or structural integrity. In fact, plant metabolites and their distribution and diversity are reflective of their essential functions in plant stress response. Furthermore, the increase of different metabolites in stressed plants is a non-enzymatic mechanism to enhance antioxidant capability in plants. Generally, these diverse solutes exhibit a high level of solubility in the cellular milieu, and their accumulation does not affect enzyme activities even at high concentrations. Moreover, the chemical nature of these osmoprotectants is very diverse that includes amino acids (proline, leucine, iso-leucine, tryptophan), amines, and gamma-amino-N-butyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, fructose) and polyols (inositol, myo-inositol), as well as different organic acids (oxalic acid, salicylic acid, ferulaic acid, etc.), accumulate in response to osmotic stress in plants."

      "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

      "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

      "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

      "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

      "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

      "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

      "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

      "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Previous studies reported that different rice cultivars are sensitive to UV-B radiation although belonging to the same ecotype. In this study, we reported the positive impact of exogenous application of beta-sitosterol (betaSito) on rice plants subjected to prolonged UV-B irradiation. Our results demonstrate that betaSito could significantly improve various aspects of growth and development when plants were subjected to UV-B stress and thus play a vital role in UV tolerance mechanisms in rice plants. The rice plants treated with betaSito (Sbeta plants) maintained their normal functions specifically photosynthesis-related processes that are generally sensitive to any stress conditions. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly higher in Sbetauvs plants than in Nbetauvs plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 2). Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants. It is important to mention that the sterol biosynthetic pathway in plants is complex that begins with squalene and is followed by its conversion to various end products. The positive role of different forms of sterols in various abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought stress has also been reported earlier."

Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Previous studies reported that different rice cultivars are sensitive to UV-B radiation although belonging to the same ecotype. In this study, we reported the positive impact of exogenous application of beta-sitosterol (betaSito) on rice plants subjected to prolonged UV-B irradiation. Our results demonstrate that betaSito could significantly improve various aspects of growth and development when plants were subjected to UV-B stress and thus play a vital role in UV tolerance mechanisms in rice plants. The rice plants treated with betaSito (Sbeta plants) maintained their normal functions specifically photosynthesis-related processes that are generally sensitive to any stress conditions. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly higher in Sbetauvs plants than in Nbetauvs plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 2). Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants. It is important to mention that the sterol biosynthetic pathway in plants is complex that begins with squalene and is followed by its conversion to various end products. The positive role of different forms of sterols in various abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought stress has also been reported earlier."

Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants. It is important to mention that the sterol biosynthetic pathway in plants is complex that begins with squalene and is followed by its conversion to various end products. The positive role of different forms of sterols in various abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought stress has also been reported earlier."

      "context": "Over the last two decades, many studies have been conducted to understand the morpho-physiological and biochemical effects of UV-B light in plants and to reveal the mechanisms of resistance especially in UV-sensitive economically important higher plants. Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Previous studies reported that different rice cultivars are sensitive to UV-B radiation although belonging to the same ecotype. In this study, we reported the positive impact of exogenous application of beta-sitosterol (betaSito) on rice plants subjected to prolonged UV-B irradiation. Our results demonstrate that betaSito could significantly improve various aspects of growth and development when plants were subjected to UV-B stress and thus play a vital role in UV tolerance mechanisms in rice plants. The rice plants treated with betaSito (Sbeta plants) maintained their normal functions specifically photosynthesis-related processes that are generally sensitive to any stress conditions. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly higher in Sbetauvs plants than in Nbetauvs plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 2). Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants. It is important to mention that the sterol biosynthetic pathway in plants is complex that begins with squalene and is followed by its conversion to various end products. The positive role of different forms of sterols in various abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought stress has also been reported earlier."

      "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

      "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."
