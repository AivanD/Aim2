Initially, we have observed phenotypic changes which clearly show markedly enhanced tolerance of Sbetauvs plants; however, Nbetauvs plants were severely damaged, and all the leaves become twisted and crinkled under stress conditions (Fig. 1A). Under non-stress conditions, shoot and root lengths of Sbeta plants were increased as compared to Nbeta plants (Sbetans vs. Nbetans). Upon prolonged exposure to UV-B stress, the shoot and root length was not affected in Sbetauvs plants (Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans); in contrast, a significant decrease in shoot (57.15% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, 64% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs) and root (40% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, 42% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs) length was noticed in Nbetauvs plants (Fig. 1B, C). Another aspect of measuring plant growth under stress conditions is the evaluation of whole plant biomass. Under normal light conditions (non-stress), our results demonstrate that plant biomass for Sbeta plants was increased up to 33% than Nbeta plants (Sbetans vs. Nbetans). Notably, the plant biomass of Sbetauvs plants was not affected even after UV-B stress. Contrastingly, we found a substantial decrease of plant biomass in Nbetauvs plants, i.e., nearly 52% lower as compared with Sbetauvs plants under prolonged UV-B irradiation stress (Fig. 1D). To check the water status of plants, we analyzed leaf relative water content both in Nbeta and Sbeta plants under non-stress and UV-B stress. No significant difference was observed between Nbetans and Sbetans plants under normal conditions, but when plants were subjected to prolonged UV-B stress, a marked decrease of 44% was noticed in Nbetauvs plants as compared to Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 1E).

Any change in photosynthetic-related parameters affects the overall sensitivity of photosynthesis and subsequently changes the plant physiology. In this study, almost 27.78% increase in Pn was recorded in Sbetauvs (vs. Sbetans) plants exposed to UV-B stress; however, no change was seen in WUEi, but Tr was reduced slightly after stress (Fig. 3). A similar increasing trend was noted for Gs, Fv/Fm, and NPQ in Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans plants after stress (Fig. 3). Furthermore, under non-stress conditions, Pn, Fv/Fm, and WUEi were also enhanced in Sbetans vs. Nbetans. In contrast, photosynthesis was negatively affected in Nbetauvs plants, and as we expected, the values for all these parameters were significantly reduced in Nbetauvs plants after UV-B irradiation (Fig. 3). In case of Pn, almost 52.20% and 26.67% reduction (Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs and Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, respectively) was observed in Nbetauvs plants (Fig. 3A).

In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

    "context": "Over the last two decades, many studies have been conducted to understand the morpho-physiological and biochemical effects of UV-B light in plants and to reveal the mechanisms of resistance especially in UV-sensitive economically important higher plants. Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Previous studies reported that different rice cultivars are sensitive to UV-B radiation although belonging to the same ecotype. In this study, we reported the positive impact of exogenous application of beta-sitosterol (betaSito) on rice plants subjected to prolonged UV-B irradiation. Our results demonstrate that betaSito could significantly improve various aspects of growth and development when plants were subjected to UV-B stress and thus play a vital role in UV tolerance mechanisms in rice plants. The rice plants treated with betaSito (Sbeta plants) maintained their normal functions specifically photosynthesis-related processes that are generally sensitive to any stress conditions. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly higher in Sbetauvs plants than in Nbetauvs plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 2). Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants. It is important to mention that the sterol biosynthetic pathway in plants is complex that begins with squalene and is followed by its conversion to various end products. The positive role of different forms of sterols in various abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought stress has also been reported earlier."

    "context": "ROS scavenging mechanisms could be categorized mainly into two types in plants which include enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense systems. In the enzymatic defense system, the main players are antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT, APX, etc.) which function together to detoxify ROS and thus maintain the redox homeostasis. In the current study, we subsequently analyzed the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and the results show a dramatic increase of antioxidant enzyme activities in Sbeta plants upon UV-B irradiation (Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans). However, we detected much lower activities of these enzymes in Nbeta plants after stress application (SNbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs, Fig. 5). This result clearly indicated that pretreatment of rice plants with betaSito activates defense signaling only in Sbeta plants via antioxidant enzymes against UV-B-induced ROS levels. Our results are in agreement with a previous study that shows a significant increment in activities of antioxidant enzymes under water stress conditions in wheat plants pretreated with betaSito. The same study also reported a significant increase in relative expression levels of SOD and dehydrin gene in plants pretreated with betaSito which clearly reveals the betaSito-regulated antioxidant system in plants under stress conditions. Importantly, improvement of oxidative status by betaSito was also reported in animal systems that ultimately enhanced the growth performance and meat quality of animals."

    "context": "Plants are vulnerable to absorption of strong UV-B light, and this can affect different aspects of plant growth and development. According to the objectives of this study, rice plants not supplemented with betaSito (Nbeta) were grown in normal light under non-stress (ns) and under prolonged UV-B stress (uvs) conditions (termed as Nbetans and Nbetauvs, respectively). Similarly, rice plants supplemented with betaSito (Sbeta) were grown under non-stress and UV-B stress conditions (and termed as Sbetans and Sbetauvs, respectively) for comparative analysis. Initially, we have observed phenotypic changes which clearly show markedly enhanced tolerance of Sbetauvs plants; however, Nbetauvs plants were severely damaged, and all the leaves become twisted and crinkled under stress conditions (Fig. 1A). Under non-stress conditions, shoot and root lengths of Sbeta plants were increased as compared to Nbeta plants (Sbetans vs. Nbetans). Upon prolonged exposure to UV-B stress, the shoot and root length was not affected in Sbetauvs plants (Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans); in contrast, a significant decrease in shoot (57.15% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, 64% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs) and root (40% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, 42% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs) length was noticed in Nbetauvs plants (Fig. 1B, C). Another aspect of measuring plant growth under stress conditions is the evaluation of whole plant biomass. Under normal light conditions (non-stress), our results demonstrate that plant biomass for Sbeta plants was increased up to 33% than Nbeta plants (Sbetans vs. Nbetans). Notably, the plant biomass of Sbetauvs plants was not affected even after UV-B stress. Contrastingly, we found a substantial decrease of plant biomass in Nbetauvs plants, i.e., nearly 52% lower as compared with Sbetauvs plants under prolonged UV-B irradiation stress (Fig. 1D). To check the water status of plants, we analyzed leaf relative water content both in Nbeta and Sbeta plants under non-stress and UV-B stress. No significant difference was observed between Nbetans and Sbetans plants under normal conditions, but when plants were subjected to prolonged UV-B stress, a marked decrease of 44% was noticed in Nbetauvs plants as compared to Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 1E). Overall, our result reveals the positive effect of betaSito on the growth performance and water status of rice plants under prolonged UV-B stress conditions. "

Further, a significant accumulation of several core metabolites that include organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others in Sbeta plants reveals betaSito-regulated activation of non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanism in rice plants under stress. Overall, this study is beneficial especially in terms of its involvement in plant growth and development; moreover, betaSito-regulated plasticity of plants during UV-B irradiation shows that its application could further be explored specifically in relation to different environmental stresses in other economically useful crop plants."

Under non-stress conditions, there were no significant differences for all the photosynthetic pigments between Nbetans and Sbetans plants except for Caro, contents of which were relatively increased in Sbetans plants (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, there was a significant reduction in the levels of Chl a, Chl b, total chlorophyll, and Caro in Nbetauvs plants after exposure to UV-B stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs). Conversely, we have found that the contents of Chl a, total chlorophyll, and Caro in Sbetauvs plants were significantly higher (Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs), whereas the content of Chl b was relatively constant (Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans) after stress (Fig. 2A-D). Moreover, we have also examined any effects on the ultrastructure of chloroplast in Nbeta and Sbeta plants subjected to prolonged UV-B stress. For this purpose, we make use of transmission electron microscopy which shows disorganization of grana stacks in the chloroplasts of leaves from Nbetauvs plants after exposure to prolonged UV-B irradiation, while no significant effect was observed in Sbetauvs as compared to non-stress plants (Fig. 2E). Collectively, the results demonstrated that betaSito was involved in maintaining chloroplast development and chlorophyll synthesis under stress conditions thus showing superior performance of Sbeta plants compared to Nbeta plants.

Any change in photosynthetic-related parameters affects the overall sensitivity of photosynthesis and subsequently changes the plant physiology. In this study, almost 27.78% increase in Pn was recorded in Sbetauvs (vs. Sbetans) plants exposed to UV-B stress; however, no change was seen in WUEi, but Tr was reduced slightly after stress (Fig. 3). A similar increasing trend was noted for Gs, Fv/Fm, and NPQ in Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans plants after stress (Fig. 3). Furthermore, under non-stress conditions, Pn, Fv/Fm, and WUEi were also enhanced in Sbetans vs. Nbetans. In contrast, photosynthesis was negatively affected in Nbetauvs plants, and as we expected, the values for all these parameters were significantly reduced in Nbetauvs plants after UV-B irradiation (Fig. 3). In case of Pn, almost 52.20% and 26.67% reduction (Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs and Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, respectively) was observed in Nbetauvs plants (Fig. 3A). Notably, this result was also consistent with reduced chlorophyll content and a decrease of plant biomass in Nbetauvs plants. In conclusion, these results clearly indicate the positive effects of betaSito application on net photosynthesis and associated gas exchange parameters in Sbeta plants under prolonged UV-B irradiation.

Overall, our result reveals the positive effect of betaSito on the growth performance and water status of rice plants under prolonged UV-B stress conditions. \nTo investigate the effect of betaSito on the biochemical snapshot of rice plants subjected to UV-B stress, we utilized a metabolomics approach to quantify the changes in specific metabolites in Nbeta and Sbeta plants under non-stress and after UV-B stress. A total of 72 key metabolites were detected and quantified using GC-TOFMS in leaf samples from Nbeta and Sbeta plants, out of which 27 belongs to organic acids, 19 belongs to sugars, 15 were amino acids, and 11 others (Supplementary Table S1). Differences in metabolite contents are visualized as a heat map that shows the overall changes in 72 metabolites under non-stress and UV-B stress conditions (Fig. 6). Under UV-B stress conditions, a large number of metabolites were induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, whereas a significant decrease in accumulation of several metabolites was recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). However, Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs, we have also noticed a reduction in levels of some organic acids and sugars. This implies a significantly different mechanism of metabolite regulation in Sbeta and Nbeta plants subjected to UV-B stress. Under non-stress conditions, we have also observed different metabolite accumulation patterns (Sbetans vs. Nbetans), with the most obvious differences recorded for organic acids and sugars (Fig. 6). In case of Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, sugars, amino acids, and other key metabolites were mainly induced, while no obvious differences were noted for organic acids (with regard to total organic acids) accumulation (Fig. 6). In total, these results thus demonstrate that exogenous application of betaSito has significantly induced several metabolites belonging to organic acids, sugars, and amino acids as well some other key metabolites in Sbeta plants compared with Nbeta plants under stress. Contrastingly, we recorded a significant downregulation of several metabolites belonging to organic acids, sugars, and amino acids in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 6). Importantly, these results also imply that application of betaSito has mainly affected the accumulation of various metabolites in rice plants under UV-B stress (Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs) rather than unstressed plants (Sbetans vs. Nbetans).

More efforts regarding betaSito and its regulatory functions in mitigating stress are therefore needed to comprehend its critical role for plant protection."

    "context": "Over the last two decades, many studies have been conducted to understand the morpho-physiological and biochemical effects of UV-B light in plants and to reveal the mechanisms of resistance especially in UV-sensitive economically important higher plants. Rice is one of the most important crops in the world. Previous studies reported that different rice cultivars are sensitive to UV-B radiation although belonging to the same ecotype. In this study, we reported the positive impact of exogenous application of beta-sitosterol (betaSito) on rice plants subjected to prolonged UV-B irradiation. Our results demonstrate that betaSito could significantly improve various aspects of growth and development when plants were subjected to UV-B stress and thus play a vital role in UV tolerance mechanisms in rice plants. The rice plants treated with betaSito (Sbeta plants) maintained their normal functions specifically photosynthesis-related processes that are generally sensitive to any stress conditions. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly higher in Sbetauvs plants than in Nbetauvs plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 2). Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants. It is important to mention that the sterol biosynthetic pathway in plants is complex that begins with squalene and is followed by its conversion to various end products. The positive role of different forms of sterols in various abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought stress has also been reported earlier.\nPhotosynthetic pigments Chl a, Chl b, and Caro are important for capturing light to perform efficient photosynthesis and are good indicators for plant adaptability to stress conditions. Therefore, we measured the content of these pigments in Nbeta and Sbeta plants under non-stress and UV-B stress. Under non-stress conditions, there were no significant differences for all the photosynthetic pigments between Nbetans and Sbetans plants except for Caro, contents of which were relatively increased in Sbetans plants (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, there was a significant reduction in the levels of Chl a, Chl b, total chlorophyll, and Caro in Nbetauvs plants after exposure to UV-B stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs). Conversely, we have found that the contents of Chl a, total chlorophyll, and Caro in Sbetauvs plants were significantly higher (Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs), whereas the content of Chl b was relatively constant (Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans) after stress (Fig. 2A-D). Moreover, we have also examined any effects on the ultrastructure of chloroplast in Nbeta and Sbeta plants subjected to prolonged UV-B stress. For this purpose, we make use of transmission electron microscopy which shows disorganization of grana stacks in the chloroplasts of leaves from Nbetauvs plants after exposure to prolonged UV-B irradiation, while no significant effect was observed in Sbetauvs as compared to non-stress plants (Fig. 2E). Collectively, the results demonstrated that betaSito was involved in maintaining chloroplast development and chlorophyll synthesis under stress conditions thus showing superior performance of Sbeta plants compared to Nbeta plants.

    "context": "ROS scavenging mechanisms could be categorized mainly into two types in plants which include enzymatic and non-enzymatic defense systems. In the enzymatic defense system, the main players are antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT, APX, etc.) which function together to detoxify ROS and thus maintain the redox homeostasis. In the current study, we subsequently analyzed the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and the results show a dramatic increase of antioxidant enzyme activities in Sbeta plants upon UV-B irradiation (Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans). However, we detected much lower activities of these enzymes in Nbeta plants after stress application (SNbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs, Fig. 5). This result clearly indicated that pretreatment of rice plants with betaSito activates defense signaling only in Sbeta plants via antioxidant enzymes against UV-B-induced ROS levels. Our results are in agreement with a previous study that shows a significant increment in activities of antioxidant enzymes under water stress conditions in wheat plants pretreated with betaSito. The same study also reported a significant increase in relative expression levels of SOD and dehydrin gene in plants pretreated with betaSito which clearly reveals the betaSito-regulated antioxidant system in plants under stress conditions. Importantly, improvement of oxidative status by betaSito was also reported in animal systems that ultimately enhanced the growth performance and meat quality of animals."

Overall, this study is beneficial especially in terms of its involvement in plant growth and development; moreover, betaSito-regulated plasticity of plants during UV-B irradiation shows that its application could further be explored specifically in relation to different environmental stresses in other economically useful crop plants."

Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants.

As a result, we found a substantial decrease of plant biomass in Nbetauvs plants, i.e., nearly 52% lower as compared with Sbetauvs plants under prolonged UV-B irradiation stress. The photosynthetic-associated characteristics were also measured which show a 27.78% increase of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in Sbetauvs plants (vs. non-stress plants).

All these findings show a positive correlation of beta-sitosterol application with growth- and development-related characteristics in rice plants during prolonged UV-B stress.

    "context": "Of all the biological processes, photosynthesis is the central and most crucial process for measuring the physiological characteristics of plants under various environmental challenges. Any change in photosynthetic-related parameters affects the overall sensitivity of photosynthesis and subsequently changes the plant physiology. In this study, almost 27.78% increase in Pn was recorded in Sbetauvs (vs. Sbetans) plants exposed to UV-B stress; however, no change was seen in WUEi, but Tr was reduced slightly after stress (Fig. 3). A similar increasing trend was noted for Gs, Fv/Fm, and NPQ in Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans plants after stress (Fig. 3). Furthermore, under non-stress conditions, Pn, Fv/Fm, and WUEi were also enhanced in Sbetans vs. Nbetans. In contrast, photosynthesis was negatively affected in Nbetauvs plants, and as we expected, the values for all these parameters were significantly reduced in Nbetauvs plants after UV-B irradiation (Fig. 3). In case of Pn, almost 52.20% and 26.67% reduction (Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs and Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, respectively) was observed in Nbetauvs plants (Fig. 3A). Notably, this result was also consistent with reduced chlorophyll content and a decrease of plant biomass in Nbetauvs plants. In conclusion, these results clearly indicate the positive effects of betaSito application on net photosynthesis and associated gas exchange parameters in Sbeta plants under prolonged UV-B irradiation.

Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly higher in Sbetauvs plants than in Nbetauvs plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 2). Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator.

    "context": "In this study, we concluded that exogenous application of the beta-sitosterol contributes positively to plant growth and stress signaling in rice plants during prolonged UV-B stress. The shoot length and root length was not affected in Sbeta plants under UV-B stress (Sbetauvs); however, a sharp decline in the shoot (57.15% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, 64% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs) and root (40% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, 42% decrease in Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs) length was recorded in Nbetauvs plants. As a result, we found a substantial decrease of plant biomass in Nbetauvs plants, i.e., nearly 52% lower as compared with Sbetauvs plants under prolonged UV-B irradiation stress. The photosynthetic-associated characteristics were also measured which show a 27.78% increase of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in Sbetauvs plants (vs. non-stress plants). Other related parameters also show an increasing trend such as Gs, Fv/Fm, and NPQ in Sbeta plants after stress is applied. In contrast, 52.20% and 26.67% reduction in Pn (Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs and Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, respectively) was observed in Nbetauvs plants. Consistently, photosynthetic pigments such as chlorophyll and carotenoids were higher in Sbeta plants; however, pigment contents were significantly reduced in Nbeta plants after stress. All these findings show a positive correlation of beta-sitosterol application with growth- and development-related characteristics in rice plants during prolonged UV-B stress. Another important part of this research shows that Sbeta plants exhibit more plasticity to UV-B irradiation due to stabilization of the antioxidant system in Sbeta plants. Activities of antioxidant enzymes including SOD, POD, CAT, and APX were enhanced only in Sbeta plants while decreased significantly in Nbeta plants upon UV-B exposure. Further, a significant accumulation of several core metabolites that include organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others in Sbeta plants reveals betaSito-regulated activation of non-enzymatic antioxidant mechanism in rice plants under stress. Overall, this study is beneficial especially in terms of its involvement in plant growth and development; moreover, betaSito-regulated plasticity of plants during UV-B irradiation shows that its application could further be explored specifically in relation to different environmental stresses in other economically useful crop plants."

Any change in photosynthetic-related parameters affects the overall sensitivity of photosynthesis and subsequently changes the plant physiology. In this study, almost 27.78% increase in Pn was recorded in Sbetauvs (vs. Sbetans) plants exposed to UV-B stress; however, no change was seen in WUEi, but Tr was reduced slightly after stress (Fig. 3). A similar increasing trend was noted for Gs, Fv/Fm, and NPQ in Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans plants after stress (Fig. 3). Furthermore, under non-stress conditions, Pn, Fv/Fm, and WUEi were also enhanced in Sbetans vs. Nbetans. In contrast, photosynthesis was negatively affected in Nbetauvs plants, and as we expected, the values for all these parameters were significantly reduced in Nbetauvs plants after UV-B irradiation (Fig. 3). In case of Pn, almost 52.20% and 26.67% reduction (Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs and Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, respectively) was observed in Nbetauvs plants (Fig. 3A). Notably, this result was also consistent with reduced chlorophyll content and a decrease of plant biomass in Nbetauvs plants. In conclusion, these results clearly indicate the positive effects of betaSito application on net photosynthesis and associated gas exchange parameters in Sbeta plants under prolonged UV-B irradiation.

This process of oxidation leads to abnormal functionality of cells by destabilizing the integrity of enzymes and cell membranes. Our current study shows that the amount of ROS was increased in Nbetauvs plants as demonstrated by elevated levels of H2O2 and O2 as well as superoxide anions (verified through NBT staining), whereas significantly lower levels of ROS were detected in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 4). Interestingly, we recorded low levels of MDA content in Sbetauvs plants upon UV-B exposure but elevated levels in Nbetauvs plants (Fig. 4). The measurement of MDA content has long been used as a lipid peroxidation marker in studies related to oxidative stress and redox signaling, and its presence in a low amount determines high tolerance in terms of decrease oxidative stress.\nLike most other stress factors, UV-B irradiation markedly induces an oxidative burst produced by increased cellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and therefore cause perpetual oxidative damages to plants. In plants, ROS exist in ionic and/or molecular states. Ionic states include hydroxyl radicals ( OH) and superoxide anions (O2 -), while molecular states mainly include hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and singlet oxygen (O2). Generally, ROS perform dual function depending on the given stress situation, and not only cause cell death but also function as a signaling molecule in response to stress. Additionally, ROS control epigenetic events and the level of phytohormones to execute developmental processes and stress responses in plants. However, normally, it is extremely difficult to distinguish between the cytotoxic and signaling events that are induced by a particular ROS. As a natural defense mechanism in plants and under normal conditions, excessive ROS levels can be efficiently scavenged via antioxidant enzymes. Several plant antioxidant enzymes such as catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), ascorbate peroxidase (APx), and others play critical roles in removing reactive oxygen species in cells directly or indirectly, thus ensuring normal metabolic reactions against the toxic effect of ROS generated by UV-B stress."

Interestingly, H2O2 and O2 contents in Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs plants were not different under non-stress conditions, but the levels of these ROS were markedly abundant in Nbetauvs plants as compared to Sbetauvs plants during the entire period of stress (Fig. 4B, C). Moreover, when the leaves were visualized using the NBT staining method, significantly intense accumulation of intracellular ROS was detected in Nbetauvs plants than in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 4A). Further, to assess membrane damage by lipid peroxidation, MDA contents were measured in plants under non-stress and stress conditions. Although MDA level was slightly increased in Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans plants, the magnitude of increase was much higher in Nbetauvs plants (up to 12.78 mumol g-1 FW) that shows an elevated activity of lipid peroxidation in Nbeta plants after stress (Fig. 4D).

Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

    "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7).

Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7).

For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants.

In higher plants, a wide variety of secondary metabolites (alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, etc.) are synthesized from primary metabolites (such as sugars, lipids, and amino acids). In plants, differential accumulation of a variety of metabolites is not directly related to their central energy metabolism or structural integrity. In fact, plant metabolites and their distribution and diversity are reflective of their essential functions in plant stress response. Furthermore, the increase of different metabolites in stressed plants is a non-enzymatic mechanism to enhance antioxidant capability in plants. Generally, these diverse solutes exhibit a high level of solubility in the cellular milieu, and their accumulation does not affect enzyme activities even at high concentrations. Moreover, the chemical nature of these osmoprotectants is very diverse that includes amino acids (proline, leucine, iso-leucine, tryptophan), amines, and gamma-amino-N-butyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, fructose) and polyols (inositol, myo-inositol), as well as different organic acids (oxalic acid, salicylic acid, ferulaic acid, etc.), accumulate in response to osmotic stress in plants."

    "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1).

Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7).

Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Furthermore, carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, fructose) and polyols (inositol, myo-inositol), as well as different organic acids (oxalic acid, salicylic acid, ferulaic acid, etc.), accumulate in response to osmotic stress in plants."

    "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

    "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

    "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light.

    "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

For organic acid metabolites in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we have observed higher accumulation such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-fold increase in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3 fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). Previous studies show that organic acid metabolites are intermediates of major carbon metabolism events such as photosynthesis and respiration in plants. Moreover, oxalic acid was reported to serve as a signaling molecule to elevate the defense level in cucumber plants. Interestingly, previous evidence show that salicylic acid positively regulates oxidative stress through the activation of antioxidant enzymes. In general, organic acids are essential for maintaining pH and redox balance in plants during the normal TCA cycle to avoid oxidative stress due to ROS.\nAfter prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy.

Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

    "context": "Interestingly, plants accumulate several metabolites (primary and secondary metabolites) in order to protect the plants from adverse conditions caused by various abiotic stresses including UV-B irradiation. In higher plants, a wide variety of secondary metabolites (alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, etc.) are synthesized from primary metabolites (such as sugars, lipids, and amino acids). In plants, differential accumulation of a variety of metabolites is not directly related to their central energy metabolism or structural integrity. In fact, plant metabolites and their distribution and diversity are reflective of their essential functions in plant stress response. Furthermore, the increase of different metabolites in stressed plants is a non-enzymatic mechanism to enhance antioxidant capability in plants. Generally, these diverse solutes exhibit a high level of solubility in the cellular milieu, and their accumulation does not affect enzyme activities even at high concentrations. Moreover, the chemical nature of these osmoprotectants is very diverse that includes amino acids (proline, leucine, iso-leucine, tryptophan), amines, and gamma-amino-N-butyric acid (GABA).

In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

    "context": "Interestingly, plants accumulate several metabolites (primary and secondary metabolites) in order to protect the plants from adverse conditions caused by various abiotic stresses including UV-B irradiation. In higher plants, a wide variety of secondary metabolites (alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, etc.) are synthesized from primary metabolites (such as sugars, lipids, and amino acids). In plants, differential accumulation of a variety of metabolites is not directly related to their central energy metabolism or structural integrity. In fact, plant metabolites and their distribution and diversity are reflective of their essential functions in plant stress response. Furthermore, the increase of different metabolites in stressed plants is a non-enzymatic mechanism to enhance antioxidant capability in plants. Generally, these diverse solutes exhibit a high level of solubility in the cellular milieu, and their accumulation does not affect enzyme activities even at high concentrations. Moreover, the chemical nature of these osmoprotectants is very diverse that includes amino acids (proline, leucine, iso-leucine, tryptophan), amines, and gamma-amino-N-butyric acid (GABA). Furthermore, carbohydrates (glucose, sucrose, fructose) and polyols (inositol, myo-inositol), as well as different organic acids (oxalic acid, salicylic acid, ferulaic acid, etc.), accumulate in response to osmotic stress in plants."

Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7).

Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions.

Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

    "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

    "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7).

Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway.

Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

Furthermore, the increase of different metabolites in stressed plants is a non-enzymatic mechanism to enhance antioxidant capability in plants. Generally, these diverse solutes exhibit a high level of solubility in the cellular milieu, and their accumulation does not affect enzyme activities even at high concentrations. Moreover, the chemical nature of these osmoprotectants is very diverse that includes amino acids (proline, leucine, iso-leucine, tryptophan), amines, and gamma-amino-N-butyric acid (GABA).

In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

Interestingly, there was a significant reduction in the levels of Chl a, Chl b, total chlorophyll, and Caro in Nbetauvs plants after exposure to UV-B stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Nbetauvs vs. Sbetauvs). Conversely, we have found that the contents of Chl a, total chlorophyll, and Caro in Sbetauvs plants were significantly higher (Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs), whereas the content of Chl b was relatively constant (Sbetauvs vs. Sbetans) after stress (Fig. 2A-D). Moreover, we have also examined any effects on the ultrastructure of chloroplast in Nbeta and Sbeta plants subjected to prolonged UV-B stress. For this purpose, we make use of transmission electron microscopy which shows disorganization of grana stacks in the chloroplasts of leaves from Nbetauvs plants after exposure to prolonged UV-B irradiation, while no significant effect was observed in Sbetauvs as compared to non-stress plants (Fig. 2E). Collectively, the results demonstrated that betaSito was involved in maintaining chloroplast development and chlorophyll synthesis under stress conditions thus showing superior performance of Sbeta plants compared to Nbeta plants.

Our current study shows that the amount of ROS was increased in Nbetauvs plants as demonstrated by elevated levels of H2O2 and O2 as well as superoxide anions (verified through NBT staining), whereas significantly lower levels of ROS were detected in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 4). Interestingly, we recorded low levels of MDA content in Sbetauvs plants upon UV-B exposure but elevated levels in Nbetauvs plants (Fig. 4). The measurement of MDA content has long been used as a lipid peroxidation marker in studies related to oxidative stress and redox signaling, and its presence in a low amount determines high tolerance in terms of decrease oxidative stress."

In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7).

Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light.

Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7).

Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

    "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

    "context": "After prolonged UV-B stress, significantly reduced levels of few organic acids were observed especially fumaric acid, oxalic acid, malic acid, shikimic acid, palmic acid, ferulaic acid, and pyruvic acid in Nbeta plants as compared to non-stress plants (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. \nUV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1).

Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1).

For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

Since direct exposure to UV-B radiation could lower the antioxidant capacity of plants, consequently, metabolic alterations could compromise the plant defense system. In this study using the metabolomics approach by GC-TOFMS, we detected 72 key metabolites including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others in Nbeta and Sbeta plants under non-stress and after UV-B stress (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table S1). We found a significant accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, the levels of which were suppressed in Nbeta plants after stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). For organic acid metabolites in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we have observed higher accumulation such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-fold increase in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3 fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). Previous studies show that organic acid metabolites are intermediates of major carbon metabolism events such as photosynthesis and respiration in plants. Moreover, oxalic acid was reported to serve as a signaling molecule to elevate the defense level in cucumber plants. Interestingly, previous evidence show that salicylic acid positively regulates oxidative stress through the activation of antioxidant enzymes. In general, organic acids are essential for maintaining pH and redox balance in plants during the normal TCA cycle to avoid oxidative stress due to ROS."

Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

In this study using the metabolomics approach by GC-TOFMS, we detected 72 key metabolites including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others in Nbeta and Sbeta plants under non-stress and after UV-B stress (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table S1). We found a significant accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, the levels of which were suppressed in Nbeta plants after stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). For organic acid metabolites in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we have observed higher accumulation such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-fold increase in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3 fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7).

    "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1).

For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6).

    "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

    "context": "Another widely recognized mechanism of plants to minimize stress-induced oxidative damage to cells and cellular components is the alteration in the levels of various metabolites which finally shape up different metabolic pathways. Since direct exposure to UV-B radiation could lower the antioxidant capacity of plants, consequently, metabolic alterations could compromise the plant defense system. In this study using the metabolomics approach by GC-TOFMS, we detected 72 key metabolites including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others in Nbeta and Sbeta plants under non-stress and after UV-B stress (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table S1). We found a significant accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, the levels of which were suppressed in Nbeta plants after stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). For organic acid metabolites in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we have observed higher accumulation such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-fold increase in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3 fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). Previous studies show that organic acid metabolites are intermediates of major carbon metabolism events such as photosynthesis and respiration in plants. Moreover, oxalic acid was reported to serve as a signaling molecule to elevate the defense level in cucumber plants. Interestingly, previous evidence show that salicylic acid positively regulates oxidative stress through the activation of antioxidant enzymes. In general, organic acids are essential for maintaining pH and redox balance in plants during the normal TCA cycle to avoid oxidative stress due to ROS."

    "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway.

Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

    "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

    "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

In this study using the metabolomics approach by GC-TOFMS, we detected 72 key metabolites including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others in Nbeta and Sbeta plants under non-stress and after UV-B stress (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table S1). We found a significant accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, the levels of which were suppressed in Nbeta plants after stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). For organic acid metabolites in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we have observed higher accumulation such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-fold increase in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3 fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7).

In contrast, several organic acids were accumulated in large amounts in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-foldsincrease in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3-fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). In case of sugars, we found that glucose, fructose, sorbitol, and trehalose were reduced in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveals that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1).

For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants.

    "context": "Another widely recognized mechanism of plants to minimize stress-induced oxidative damage to cells and cellular components is the alteration in the levels of various metabolites which finally shape up different metabolic pathways. Since direct exposure to UV-B radiation could lower the antioxidant capacity of plants, consequently, metabolic alterations could compromise the plant defense system. In this study using the metabolomics approach by GC-TOFMS, we detected 72 key metabolites including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others in Nbeta and Sbeta plants under non-stress and after UV-B stress (Fig. 6, Supplementary Table S1). We found a significant accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, the levels of which were suppressed in Nbeta plants after stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6). For organic acid metabolites in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we have observed higher accumulation such as 4.5-fold increase in oxalic acid, 6.2-fold increase in fumaric acid, 5-fold increase in salicylic acid, and 6.3 fold increase in benzoic acid followed by 2.6-fold increase in pyruvic acid (Figs. 6 and 7). Previous studies show that organic acid metabolites are intermediates of major carbon metabolism events such as photosynthesis and respiration in plants. Moreover, oxalic acid was reported to serve as a signaling molecule to elevate the defense level in cucumber plants. Interestingly, previous evidence show that salicylic acid positively regulates oxidative stress through the activation of antioxidant enzymes. In general, organic acids are essential for maintaining pH and redox balance in plants during the normal TCA cycle to avoid oxidative stress due to ROS."

In case of amino acids, we found an obvious reduction in the levels of glycine and tryptophan in Nbeta plants under UV-B stress as compared to non-stress (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the relative abundance of amino acids such as tryptophan, isoleucine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) was increased up to 17-folds, 3.2-folds, and 2.2-folds, respectively, in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). Analyzing the other key metabolite profile in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants, we found 4.9-folds and 2.7-fold increase in 1-hexadecanol and 2-aminoadipic acid, respectively (Fig. 7). Accumulation of different metabolites is crucial for the activation of various signaling and biochemical pathways in plants to overcome environmental challenges especially under high UV-B light. Differential accumulation of metabolites (including organic acids, sugars, amino acids, and others) between Nbeta and Sbeta plants suggest that various metabolic pathways are regulated in plants through beta-sitosterol, which further explains the underlying mechanisms of UV-B stress tolerance in Sbeta plants. Overall, these results imply that betaSito is an essential part of stress signaling and participates in the tolerance mechanism against UV-B in rice. Importantly, differential accumulation of several key metabolites in Sbeta plants is regulated via exogenous application of betaSito and is associated with sugar and amino acid metabolism, GABA shunt, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.

The rice plants treated with betaSito (Sbeta plants) maintained their normal functions specifically photosynthesis-related processes that are generally sensitive to any stress conditions. Total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels were significantly higher in Sbetauvs plants than in Nbetauvs plants under UV-B stress (Fig. 2). Moreover, ultrastructure examination of chloroplast grana revealed abnormal grana stacks only in Nbetauvs plants, which remain intact in Sbetauvs plants as compared to non-stress conditions (Fig. 2). Further, the rate of net photosynthesis (Pn) was significantly higher with relatively constant WUEi in Sbetauvs plants (Fig. 3), which clearly indicates the plasticity of Sbeta plants and shows the important role of betaSito as a plant growth regulator. An interesting report has recently shown that betaSito could serve as an important growth regulator and play protective role under stress conditions. Recently, Li et al. reported that betaSito treated plants had significantly higher Chl, Pn, and WUEi under stress conditions as compared to untreated plants. It is important to mention that the sterol biosynthetic pathway in plants is complex that begins with squalene and is followed by its conversion to various end products. The positive role of different forms of sterols in various abiotic stresses such as low temperature and drought stress has also been reported earlier."

    "context": "UV-B stress can induce fluctuations in carbohydrate metabolism thereby affecting CO2 assimilation and partitioning of sugars from source to sink. Soluble sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose accumulate more in the cytoplasm and play a crucial role as plant osmolytes during various stresses. Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7). Conversely, the levels of these sugars were low in Nbetauvs plants when stress is applied (Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans, Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S1). Trehalose is important for maintaining ionic dynamics in leaf and stem tissues during stress. The amount of mannitol levels may increase in response to UV-B stress for an osmoprotective and antagonistic function against free radicals and thus stabilized the structure of macromolecules. It is also notable that glycolysis which is an oxygen-independent metabolic pathway of respiration converts glucose into pyruvate and provides energy. In the current study, the levels of glucose and pyruvic acid were significantly triggered in Sbeta plants indicating betaSito-regulated glycolysis which might be due to the upregulation of enzymes involved in the glycolytic pathway. In case of amino acids, low levels of several metabolites were recorded in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants after stress; however, accumulation of many amino acids was induced in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

For proline, we noticed an increased accumulation in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans and Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans, but the level of increase was higher in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans plants (Fig. 6). For tryptophan, significantly low levels were detected in Nbetauvs vs. Nbetans but increase in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs and in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetans (Figs. 6 and 7). Apparently, proline serves as stress-related signal and participates across different metabolic pathways including TCA and the phenylpropanoid pathways. Tryptophan is another important amino acid which is required for the formation of various secondary growth metabolites, namely phytoalexins, indole glucosinolates, alkaloids, and serotonin. The spatial and temporal distribution of these metabolites is necessary for plant defense and acclimatization under stress conditions. Generally, free amino acids are constituents of proteins, protein chaperons, and precursors for secondary metabolites and serve as signaling molecules to protect plants during interaction with the environment. Further, the non-enzymatic mechanism of detoxification of free radicals in plants is regulated through alterations in secondary metabolites. These secondary metabolites have broad-spectrum defensive roles, such as enzyme modulators and enzymatic activity, allelopathic, protection against UV-absorption, defense against herbivores, and antioxidant to neutralize free radicals. Based on this evidence, it is highly likely that the application of betaSito enhanced the tolerance level of Sbeta plants through reprogramming of several core metabolites that eventually shape up the primary and secondary metabolism in rice plants under UV-B stress."

Sugars are also important to supply energy for plant growth. In our study, analysis of sugars in Sbetauvs vs. Nbetauvs plants reveal that trehalose, mannitol, glucose, fructose, and raffinose were increased significantly (up to 19-folds, 4.5-folds, 6-folds, 2.3-folds, and 5.1-folds, respectively) after stress is applied (Figs. 6 and 7).
